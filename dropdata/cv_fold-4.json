For the Bears offense, the unit hoped to provide more support for Mitchell Trubisky in his first NFL away game. \"The kid's going to be special and we've got to do our jobs around him; keep getting in the right spot, make plays and catch the football, and making sure we're keeping him out of first-and-17s,\" offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains stated. \"We have a lot of faith and confidence in Mitchell.\" To do this, USA Today's Lorin Cox wrote the offensive line needed to stop Ravens nose tackle Michael Pierce, whose 13 stops in 2017 tied for fifth among defensive linemen. On defense, the Bears entered the game with the sixth-ranked defense (allowing 305 yards per game) that also ranked ninth in average yards allowed per play (5.07). With Danny Trevathan returning from suspension, the defense faced a Ravens offense that ranked sixth in rushing with 130.4 yards per game. On the other hand, Baltimore's offensive line - particularly the guards - had been struggling due to injuries, and Cox wrote the defense should take advantage of the openings. While the Bears had yet to record an interception in 2017, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco had thrown 33 in his last 31 games, including one in ten consecutive games; Cox added, \"It's up to this defense to actually finish the turnover.\" The first five drives of the game ended with punts. The Bears opted for a run-based attack for much of the game; on their first scoring drive in the second quarter, all but one play was a run, with the series ending on Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal. On the Ravens' next drive, Maxx Williams was stripped by Christian Jones and Trevathan recovered the loose ball. Although the Bears were unable to capitalize on the takeaway, the defense recorded another turnover on the next drive when Bryce Callahan intercepted Flacco's pass intended for Breshad Perriman. On a halfback option, Tarik Cohen eventually threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller to put the Bears up 10-0. Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal to put the Ravens on the scoreboard with three seconds remaining in the first half. During the third quarter, Trubisky led a 66-yard drive that ended with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Dion Sims. During the ensuing kickoff, Joshua Bellamy appeared to trip Ravens kick returner Bobby Rainey, but Rainey instead got back up and ran 96 yards for a touchdown. Upon review, the referees determined Bellamy's hand did not touch Rainey. Subsequently, the Bears committed two turnovers: Cohen fumbled at the Bears' 39-yard line - which set up Tucker's 31-yard field goal to narrow the gap to four points - and Trubisky was strip-sacked by Lardarius Webb with C. J. Mosley recovering. The Ravens reached the Bears' 30-yard line, where Flacco was intercepted by Adrian Amos, who returned his first career interception 90 yards for the touchdown to put the Bears up by 11 points with 5:08 left in the game. However, Tucker kicked a 50-yard field goal with 2:53 remaining, while Michael Campanaro scored on a 77-yard punt return touchdown and Flacco completed the two-point conversion to Nick Boyle to tie the game at 24 apiece and enter overtime. Neither team was able to score on their first drive; on Chicago's second series, the offense was pinned at its own seven-yard line. Jordan Howard recorded a 53-yard run on the first play of the possession, which was later followed by Trubisky's 18-yard pass to Kendall Wright on third down to draw the Bears closer. Barth kicked a 40-yard field goal to win the game. It was the Bears' first road victory since 2015 against the Buccaneers, breaking a ten-game losing streak. The Bears' rushing attack resulted in a career high 167 rushing yards on 36 carries for Howard, while Cohen had 14 carries for 32 yards. Trubisky threw just 16 passes, completing eight for 113 yards and a touchdown. John Fox explained the Ravens were the reason for the run-based strategy, having used the same philosophy with the 2012 Denver Broncos; in that team's game against Baltimore, the Broncos ran 44 times against just 21 passing plays despite the presence of Peyton Manning.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many yards longer was Barth's second field goal over his first one?", "answer": {"number": "16", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "ff8d37de-9de2-4379-8a2d-368a89515f00"}, {"question": "Who threw the longest pass?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Trubisky"]}, "query_id": "87914db7-6fd1-49c2-aa22-030c87f700d5"}, {"question": "How many more running plays than passing plays did the Broncos have?", "answer": {"number": "23", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "e5a21e96-df0c-41a0-884b-aebb9ddb20cc", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_1422": {"passage": "Coming off their home win over the Seahawks, the Cowboys flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 9 NFC East duel with the Philadelphia Eagles with both teams fighting for the division lead.

On 6 May, five Abu Sayyaf gunmen raided a Malaysian fish farm on Baik Island Sabah, kidnapped the fish farm manager and took him to Jolo island.

"With the fall of Valencia and the entry of the viceroy into the city in late 1521, a moderate repression started.  Viceroy Diego Hurtado de Mendoza did not wish to start a new revolt, but took action against the most important of the leaders, and issued a general pardon to minor agermanats who had merely served in the army. However, Mendoza was replaced as viceroy by Germaine of Foix, Ferdinand's second wife, who returned to the country with Charles and a new German husband .  She favored a harsher policy toward the rebels, and approximately 800 death sentences to former rebels would be dispensed.  Sources differ on how much she personally ordered, but it seems likely at least 100 death warrants were directly approved of by her.  Heavy fines were imposed on the guilds as punishment, as well as a total of more than 360,000 ducats of fines to all cities that had sided with the Germanies, and 2,000,000 ducats of fines were levied in compensations for damages sustained by properties during the war. The period of heavier repression ended on December 23, 1524, when Germaine signed a pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia and by extension the other Germanies.  King Charles signed an additional general pardon in 1528, suggesting that scattered reprisals might have continued afterward.  Germaine was in favor of the integration of Spain, and Catalan nationalists point to her pardon as one of the first official documents in Aragon written in Castilian Spanish.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many years did these events span for?", "answer": {"number": "7", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "a18fca92-f3f4-4497-bb39-e6c841b672c1"}, {"question": "How many years separated the two pardons signed?", "answer": {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "15bd00a5-4551-4b38-8a8c-c23dc1789acd"}, {"question": "What happened first, start of  moderate repression, or Charles signed pardon?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["start of  moderate repression"]}, "query_id": "bd89f624-a0b5-4cc6-ba58-cc23d2f90a0b"}, {"question": "How many minimum ducats fines were imposed on the guilds as punishment?", "answer": {"number": "2360000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "26108bf2-f7e6-4412-9bbd-da44ba15514d"}, {"question": "What happened first: fall of Valencia or end of heavier repression?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["fall of Valencia"]}, "query_id": "36c897d8-8ec1-4661-8c39-e47d058cdd1a"}, {"question": "What happened second: fall of Valencia or end of heavier repression?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["end of heavier repression"]}, "query_id": "e1e86de0-65bc-4114-9391-4efa00d33c69"}, {"question": "Who had the least ducat of fines, the guilds as punishment or the cities who sided with Germany?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["guilds as punishment"]}, "query_id": "6b5483df-5e27-4daa-b578-2870040fd7bd"}, {"question": "Who was viceroy first, Mendoza or Germaine of Foix?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Mendoza"]}, "query_id": "11c8c04e-194f-474a-97d3-aacd462baa4b", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "Which incurred more fines, guilds or cities?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["cities"]}, "query_id": "90c99d73-aebf-488f-aef9-00abcf5db64b", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many more ducats were paid in fined for compensations for damages sustained by properties during the war than the cities paid?", "answer": {"number": "1640000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "39c28647-b4c6-4200-b538-5931caf43c64", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many years passed between Germaine signing a pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia and King Charles signing a general pardon?", "answer": {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "d02e28b6-31e5-4bb6-9785-fdc33bbbf7c4", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "Who did Germaine of Foix replace?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Mendoza"]}, "query_id": "5431d735-b486-49eb-a16e-6773a469e55a", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many more ducats were levied for damages sustained by properties than levied to cities that had sided with the Germanies?", "answer": {"number": "1640000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "e0cc8f23-87cd-474d-b178-66f0deba1c0c", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many more ducats of fines were levied in compensations for damages than fines to all cities that had sided with the Germanies?", "answer": {"number": "1640000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "61c92e3f-ed87-4468-bd96-a761b63d0dac", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many death sentences are speculated to have not been directly approved by Germaine of Foix?", "answer": {"number": "700", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "29421386-e0e3-4bfa-b571-607a56babeeb", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_528": {"passage": "Hoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Steelers, the Bengals flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for a Week 9 intraconference duel with the Buffalo Bills.

At the 1521 Diet of Worms Emperor Charles V had Martin Luther banned and the proliferation of his writings prohibited, which in 1529 provoked the Protestation at Speyer by several Lutheran estates.  The tensions culminated to an open conflict over the Lutheran Augsburg Confession of 1530, the Apology of which, written by Philipp Melanchthon, was rejected by the Emperor. In turn several Lutheran states led by Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse met at the town of Schmalkalden, where they established the Schmalkaldic League in 1531. In 1544 Charles V returned to Germany from the Italian War after he had signed the Treaty of Cr\u00e9py and began to forge alliances not only with Pope Paul III but also with Lutheran princes, foremost with Duke Maurice of Saxony, the Albertine cousin of Saxon Elector John Frederick I. In view of the Emperor's preparations for battle, the Schmalkaldic leaders on 4 July 1546 gathered at Ichtershausen and agreed that a preventive strike would be advisable, as long as Charles V had not concentrated a significant amount of mercenaries.

3-and-out, Denver sustained a long drive deep into Oakland territory. However, the Raiders orchestrated a successful goal-line stand, forcing Denver to turn the ball over on downs after a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line was stopped. Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13-3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie running back Knowshon Moreno. It was the first touchdown of Moreno's NFL career. Oakland was forced to punt on their next drive. However, on Denver's first play from scrimmage, running back Correll Buckhalter fumbled the ball at their own 16-yard line, giving Oakland the ball in Denver territory for just the 3rd time on the day. However, 2 plays later, Raiders running back Darren McFadden fumbled the ball for the second time on the day (the first time was recovered by Oakland), giving Denver the ball back at their own 11. They then drove 88 yards in 16 plays and over 8 minutes, although the Raiders again held them out of the end zone, leading to a Prater 24-yard field goal. The Broncos won the game primarily on the strength of their running game and the defense. Correll Buckhalter ran 14 times for 108 yards, while rookie Knowshown Moreno ran 21 times for 90 yards. Overall, the Broncos had 215 yards rushing on the day. The defense held the Raiders to just 137 total yards and 9 first downs, caused 2 interceptions and 1 fumble, and also sacked JaMarcus Russell 3 times, 2 of them by star defensive end Elvis Dumervil (who had 4 in the previous game against the Cleveland Browns). Russell had just 61 yards passing on 21 attempts with 2 interceptions, giving him a quarterback rating of 22.6.

TE Tony Gonzalez met with Chiefs GM Carl Peterson during the bye week and inquired about a trade to a playoff contender. Gonzalez, who had always said he would like to end his career with the Chiefs, voiced his desire to play for a Super Bowl contending team and the rebuilding Chiefs would like to acquire extra draft picks. Buffalo, Atlanta, Green Bay, Philadelphia, and the New York Giants had been in contact with the Chiefs regarding Gonzalez. The Giants were considered to be the front-runners, but showed \"lukewarm\" interest. The Packers offered a third round draft choice, but the deal was not finalized, and Gonzalez remained with the Chiefs after the trading deadline passed. RB Larry Johnson was charged with simple assault for allegedly pushing a woman at a Kansas City nightclub in February, the third time he has faced assault charges against a woman. Johnson was also reportedly offered by the Chiefs for a trade. Days later, coach Herm Edwards ruled Johnson out of the Chiefs' upcoming game against Tennessee as a result of a violation of team rules. Edwards stated that it was not in response to Johnson's legal troubles, but instead of insubordination. Days later, reports surfaced that Johnson was under investigation for allegedly telling a woman that he was going to kill her boyfriend then spat in her face at Kansas City's Club Blonde on October 10, just four days prior to his court hearing for a separate incident. Johnson's pattern of behavior could lead to a possible suspension under the NFL's personal conduct policy. Johnson made a public apology on October 22. As a result of his October 10 incident, Johnson was de-activated for the Chiefs' game against the New York Jets. As a result, Johnson was charged with simple assault for the second time in two weeks.

1490, Frederick was able to regain the Austrian lands. However, he could not enforce the Habsburg succession to the Hungarian throne and in 1491 his son King Maximilian I signed the Peace of Pressburg with Vladislaus Jagiellon, who was elected Matthias' successor in Hungary. The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was born in 1506, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II. The double wedding celebrated at St. Stephen's Cathedral decisively advanced the Habsburg succession agenda. During his reign in Hungary, the new Polish king would go on to undo many of Matthias' efforts, unmaking the reformed system of taxation, the standing army, and the centralized authority of the monarch. Hungary's nobles would act in complicity with this, contributing to the weakening of the country until 1526, when Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, whereby King Louis II was killed. The Habsburg archduke Ferdinand of Austria by his marriage with Anne of Bohemia and Hungary claimed the succession, he was enfoffed with the Bohemian kingdom by his elder brother Emperor Charles V and also reached the consent of the Hungarian magnates.

period for Scotland, as it was for much of Europe; the years 1695-97 saw catastrophic famine in present-day Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden plus an estimated two million deaths in France and Northern Italy.  Scotland's economy was relatively small, its range of exports very limited and it was in a weak position in relation to England, its powerful neighbour . In an era of economic rivalry in Europe, Scotland was incapable of protecting itself from the effects of English competition and legislation. The kingdom had no reciprocal export trade and its once thriving industries such as shipbuilding were in deep decline; goods that were in demand had to be bought from England for sterling. Moreover, the Navigation Acts further increased economic dependence on England by limiting Scotland's shipping, and the Royal Scots Navy was relatively small. A series of domestic conflicts, including the 1639-51 Wars of the Three Kingdoms and unrest related to religious differences between 1670-1690 exhausted the people and diminished their resources. The so-called \"seven ill years\" of the 1690s saw widespread crop failures and famine, while Scotland's deteriorating economic position led to calls for a political or customs union with England. However, the stronger feeling among Scots was that the country should become a great mercantile and colonial power like England. In response a number of solutions were enacted by the Parliament of Scotland: in 1695the Bank of Scotland was established; the Act for the Settling of Schools created a parish-based system of public education throughout Scotland; and the Company of Scotland was chartered with capital to be raised by public subscription to trade with \"Africa and the Indies\".", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many years did the catastrophic famine for Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden last?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b4e80f48-6c1c-48cf-8206-c1b16fee9210"}, {"question": "Who had gthe stronger economy, Scotland or England?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["England"]}, "query_id": "a5627ef8-bafe-499e-9368-88bcc98bf07c"}, {"question": "How many years did the religious unrest in Scotland last for?", "answer": {"number": "20", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "95f71c7f-4a26-4fa8-b2a9-cf2e7fa64bef"}, {"question": "WHich occured first for Scotland, the \"seven ill years\" or the Wars of the Three Kingdoms?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Wars of the Three Kingdoms"]}, "query_id": "5072fc69-ef88-4310-8c26-d3f137b69342"}, {"question": "When did the Wars of the Three Kingdoms end?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": "1651"}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "464fe629-4c44-427b-8d9a-96ea80d90c80"}, {"question": "The religious unrest went on for how many years?", "answer": {"number": "20", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "5fa9aa68-aecd-4d60-b0d3-dc9b654ad0c7"}, {"question": "How many total years did the catastrophic famine last for?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "5ca8c793-88e7-40a4-8914-ea260f5539ea"}, {"question": "What happened first, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms or the establishment of the Bank of Scotland?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Wars of the Three Kingdoms"]}, "query_id": "feed7b2b-fb2b-486c-aee9-fc9e32b0a37b"}, {"question": "How many years was the Wars of the Three Kingdoms?", "answer": {"number": "12", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b1ef1403-9254-4e01-b841-d766a44f41ef", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many years did the religious differences last?", "answer": {"number": "20", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "9f9e8205-ea94-4c52-b126-5170b4732bee", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many years did the famine in Europe last?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "2b315f36-f81d-4f53-b8f6-6d7c7af75301", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "In the late 17th century, how was the Scottish economy compared to the English economy?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["relatively small"]}, "query_id": "d557d1e5-0fa4-444b-ad3f-ce8ae64b3ee9", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "What industry was harmed by the Navigation Act?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["shipping"]}, "query_id": "6116f9b6-643e-48b6-8b06-73677f3c3441", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many years did the Wars of the Three Kingdoms last?", "answer": {"number": "12", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "3e51bb2a-e43a-4d69-bc24-c066b19ce36f", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "history_2140": {"passage": "In the county, the population was spread out with 25.60% under the age of 18, 9.20% from 18 to 24, 32.20% from 25 to 44, 22.30% from 45 to 64, and 10.70% who were 65 years of age or older.

When Danish-held Varberg surrendered to Swedish forces in 1565, 150 Danish mercenaries escaped the subsequent massacre of the garrison by defecting to Sweden. Among them was Pontus de la Gardie, who thereafter became an important Swedish commander in the Livonian War. Livonia was also affected by the naval campaign of Danish admiral Peter or Per Munck, who bombarded Swedish Reval from sea in July 1569. The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark the supreme and dominating power in Northern Europe, yet failed to restore the Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led to a series of conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued.

On the ensuing possession, Green Bay drove into Atlanta territory but Atlanta CB Brent Grimes forced a fumble from Green Bay RB Ryan Grant. The Falcons once again took the ball down the field for a touchdown, this time on a RB Michael Turner 1-yard run, and with just over 12 minutes remaining in the second quarter, Atlanta led 14-0. Green Bay cut the lead to 14-6 at the half on a pair of second-quarter field goals by K Mason Crosby. In the second half it was all about the Green Bay defense which posted a shutout in the final 42 minutes of the game. Midway through the third quarter, Crosby boomed a 56 yarder to cut it to 14-9. Then after a stand by the Packer defense, Packers QB Aaron Rodgers hooked up with WR James Jones on a 70-yard touchdown that put the Packers ahead for good 15-14 (failed 2-pt conv.). On the first play of the fourth quarter Rodgers went to work again and hooked up with WR Greg Jennings on a 29-yard touchdown and Crosby added his fourth field goal with 1:10 remaining to seal it for the visiting Packers. Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers completed 26 of 39 passes for 396 yards and 2 TD's to lead the offense and remain the early season favorite for MVP. Atlanta QB Matt Ryan struggled, completing 18 of 32 passes for 167 yards, with a TD and 2 INT (by S Charlie Peprah & CB Jarrett Bush).

Trailing 21-7, Mike Holmgren blistered the paint in the locker room and a different Hawks team took the field in the second half. Seattle scored 20 unanswered points to lead 27-21 and looked to have put the game away after a Lofa Tatupu interception late in the game. However, RB Maurice Morris fumbled on the Ram 7-yard line with 2:48 left. A few plays later Ram QB Marc Bulger hit Torry Holt with a 67-yard TD pass to give the Rams a 28-27 lead with 1:38 remaining. Matt Hasselbeck engineered a final drive from the Seahawks' 17-yard line and led the team to the Rams' 31-yard line. A premature celebration erupted on the Rams' sideline as the Seahawks were called for an illegal formation after Hasselbeck spiked the ball to stop the clock with four seconds left in the game. The Rams believed the Seahawks had committed a false start which would have resulted in a ten-second runoff on the clock that would have ended the game. Instead, the Seahawks were penalized five yards, pushing them back to the 36-yard line. Despite the setback, Josh Brown still kicked a 54-yard field goal to win the game, 30-28. Brown's kick was tied for the second longest game-winning field goal in NFL history, behind Tom Dempsey's 63-yard effort in 1970.

Exploiting the situation, Noailles captured Camprodon on 22 May, but a larger Spanish army under the Duke of Villahermosa forced him to withdraw back to Roussillon in August. The Catalan campaign settled down in 1690, but a new front in Piedmont-Savoy proved more eventful. A ferment of religious animosities and Savoyard hatred of the French produced a theatre characterised by massacres and atrocities: constant guerrilla attacks by the armed populace were met by draconian reprisals. In 1690 Saint-Ruth took most of the Victor Amadeus II's exposed Duchy of Savoy, routing the Savoyard army in the process until only the great fortress of Montm\u00e9lian remained in ducal hands; while to the south in Piedmont, Nicolas Catinat led 12,000 men and soundly defeated Victor Amadeus at the Battle of Staffarda on 18 August.

Browns kicker Phil Dawson successfully converted another field goal from 42-yards away with just under five minutes left in the third quarter, trimming the score to 10-6.  Shortly afterwards, Dawson made the score 10-9 with a 22-yard field goal, his third of the day, and narrowing the Eagles' lead to one point with about fourteen minutes left in the game.  The underdog Browns continued the scoring streak, taking the lead on an errant Michael Vick throw and 27-yard interception return touchdown by D'Qwell Jackson approximately thirty seconds later.

Washington continued an old tradition of playing its arch-rival Cowboys in the first week of the season. Both teams were unimpressive and the Redskins offense sputtered throughout the game, but they finally won 13-10 after a touchdown pass by Tony Romo was nullified after a holding call. They hosted the Texans in Week 2, but good all-around offensive performance (especially by McNabb, who passed for 426 yards and a touchdown) failed to secure a win. The game tied at 27-27 and went into overtime where Houston kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard FG, ending the match at 30-27. After this, the Redskins lost to St. Louis 30-16 before McNabbs return to Philadelphia. Although Washington did not deliver a particularly strong performance, they won 16-12 after Eagles QB Michael Vick was injured and replaced by Kevin Kolb. In Week 5, they hosted Green Bay for only the second time since 1979 (the first was in 2004) and beat them 16-13. After losing a Sunday Night match to the Colts, Washington beat Chicago in Week 7. Although McNabb threw two interceptions, the team took advantage of their opponents porous O-line to sack and pick off Jay Cutler (American football) four times, winning 17-14. After losing a 37-25 trap game in Detroit, the Redskins went on their bye week and returned to host Philadelphia on MNF for the second straight year. As rain fell on Fedex Field, the Eagles proceeded to crush Washington 59-28 with eight touchdowns. In contrast to the huge numbers put up by Michael Vick, McNabb looked decidedly unimpressive, with two touchdown passes and three interceptions (one returned for a TD).

Flying his flag in the French-built pre-dreadnought Tsesarevich, Vitgeft proceeded to lead his six battleships, four cruisers, and 14 torpedo boat destroyers into the Yellow Sea in the early morning of 10 August 1904. Waiting for him was Admiral T\u014dg\u014d and his fleet of four battleships, 10 cruisers, and 18 torpedo boat destroyers. At approximately 12:15, the battleship fleets obtained visual contact with each other, and at 13:00 with T\u014dg\u014d crossing Vitgeft's T, they commenced main battery fire at a range of about eight miles, the longest ever conducted up to that time. For about thirty minutes the battleships pounded one another until they had closed to less than four miles and began to bring their secondary batteries into play. At 18:30, a hit from one of T\u014dg\u014d's battleships struck Vitgeft's flagship's bridge, killing him instantly. With the Tsesarevich's helm jammed and their admiral killed in action, she turned from her battle line, causing confusion among her fleet. However, T\u014dg\u014d was determined to sink the Russian flagship and continued pounding her, and it was saved only by the gallant charge of the American-built Russian battleship Retvizan, whose captain successfully drew away T\u014dg\u014d's heavy fire from the Russian flagship. Knowing of the impending battle with the battleship reinforcements arriving from Russia , T\u014dg\u014d chose not to risk his battleships by pursuing his enemy as they turned about and headed back into Port Arthur, thus ending naval history's longest-range gunnery duel up to that time and the first modern clash of steel battleship fleets on the high seas.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many total battleships, cruisers and torpedo boat destroyers combined did Vitgeft proceed to lead to the Yellow Sea in 1904?", "answer": {"number": "24", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "e3fd2bab-fcaf-4c1e-86e2-8e49b8e2097e"}, {"question": "How many minutes after the time the battleship fleets obtained visual contact with each other did a torpedo strike Vitgefts flagship's bridge, killing him?", "answer": {"number": "315", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "bbce639e-3fdf-4cbb-a724-9861179637f3"}, {"question": "How many total cruisers, battleships, crusiers, and torpedo boat destroyers did Admiral T\u014dg\u014d's fleet consist of combined?", "answer": {"number": "32", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "0fb2962a-2a61-42f4-abab-0530f743b96c"}, {"question": "Who commanded the fleet first, Makarov or Vitgeft?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Makarov"]}, "query_id": "b026887b-aa8e-41e1-8571-a44ea4136676"}, {"question": "Who died last, Makarov or Vitgeft?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Vitgeft"]}, "query_id": "74aaa378-558f-4018-81f3-e6f5a7bd6ee3"}, {"question": "How many more battleships than cruisers did Vitgeft have?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "936948ad-b2f4-49fa-ba69-4defbb34d658"}, {"question": "What did the fleet have more of, cruisers or torpedo boat destroyers?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["torpedo boat destroyers"]}, "query_id": "1e26fe43-632e-47d1-b34a-b64dfeec4a74"}, {"question": "Who had more battleships, Vitgeft or T\u014dg\u014d?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Vitgeft"]}, "query_id": "09cd1bb6-91cf-4a92-af26-3cbccab1418d"}, {"question": "How many more cruisers did T\u014dg\u014d have than Vitgeft?", "answer": {"number": "6", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "98fd1262-2b60-4495-8caf-0d60dcb53588"}, {"question": "Which type of boat did T\u014dg\u014d have most of?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["torpedo boat destroyers"]}, "query_id": "c9c50214-b811-4c4b-a937-0a7bf95cd6e9"}, {"question": "How many types of boats did the fleet have?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "14c43f6e-f8d8-44d4-8415-ede3aee9661d"}, {"question": "How many miles did the ships travel toward each other after the commenced firing?", "answer": {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "7154f232-bab6-48a1-9c5b-2af68d8b3288"}, {"question": "Who died first, Vitgeft or T\u014dg\u014d?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Vitgeft"]}, "query_id": "f5d34b5c-f7ba-4091-868e-66dbaedfab22"}, {"question": "Who was the Admiral of the battle fleet first, Wilgelm Vitgeft or Stepan Makarov?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Stepan Makarov"]}, "query_id": "85033a62-ffc3-4355-be1c-28574414ad10"}, {"question": "How many total ships did Vitgeft lead into battle on August 10, 1904?", "answer": {"number": "24", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "9f1c5c00-7a0a-484e-97fe-c55a1c0888db"}, {"question": "How many ships did Admiral Togo command at the battle on August 10, 1904?", "answer": {"number": "32", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "9c44233e-10b3-430c-9fba-62e20d2528ed"}, {"question": "Which Admiral was the first to die in battle, Wilgem Vitgeft or Stepan Makarov?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Stepan Makarov"]}, "query_id": "d2984e54-3ef4-4c3a-9b44-c10729612655"}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_1793": {"passage": "The Bengals' tenth game was an AFC duel with the Bills.

At the turn of the 17th century, three of these states emerged as the leading powers: the Sultanate of Banten in western Java, the Sultanate of Mataram in inland central Java, and the Duchy of Surabaya in coastal eastern Java. Mataram consolidated its power by absorbing other principalities: Pajang in c.\u20091588, Demak , Madiun  and Kediri . Following Mataram's unsuccessful westward expedition against Banten in about 1597, Mataram turned its expansion eastward, into areas under the influence of Surabaya. The Duchy of Surabaya was centered roughly in today's city of Surabaya in the northern coast of eastern Java. It was a wealthy and powerful state, and the city was an important port in the trade route between Malacca and the Spice Islands., The city was approximately 37 kilometres  in circumference, and was fortified by canals and cannons. Allied with the nearby state of Pasuruan, the Duchy expanded its influence throughout the eastern part of Java in the beginning of the 17th century. By 1622, it was in control of Gresik and Sedayu in eastern Java. It was also the overlord of Sukadana and Banjarmasin in southern Borneo. More doubtful reports said it might have also extended its influence to Pasuruan, Blambangan, the Brantas valley region, and Wirasaba. Other than these, Surabaya was also allied with Tuban, Malang, Kediri, Lasem, all in eastern Java, as well as Madura off the northern coast.

assisted the settlers in defeating Chief Hancock. Chief Blount captured Chief Hancock, and the settlers executed him in 1712. In 1713 the Southern Tuscarora lost their Fort Neoheroka, located in Greene County. About 950 people were killed or captured and sold into slavery in the Caribbean or New England by Colonel Moore and his South Carolina troops. His forces were made up of 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies, mostly Yamasee and Cherokee, historic competitors to the Tuscarora. At this point, the majority of the surviving Southern Tuscarora began migrating to New York to escape the settlers in North Carolina. Their leader declared that those remaining in the South after 1722 were no longer members of the tribe. They joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy, and were accepted as the sixth nation. The remaining Tuscarora signed a treaty with the settlers in June 1718. It granted them a tract of land on the Roanoke River in what is now Bertie County. This was the area already occupied by Tom Blount, and was specified as 56,000 acres ; Tom Blount was recognized by the Legislature of North Carolina as King Tom Blount. The remaining Southern Tuscarora were removed from their homes on the Pamlico River and forced to Bertie. In 1722 the colony chartered Bertie County.

Prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, protests about local racial segregation which began quietly in Franklin Street restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance. The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963 Speaker Ban Law prohibiting speeches by communists on state campuses in North Carolina.  The law was immediately criticized by University Chancellor William Brantley Aycock and University President William Friday, but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965.  Small amendments to allow \"infrequent\" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to Marxist speaker Herbert Aptheker and civil liberties activist Frank Wilkinson; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened \"Dan Moore's Wall\" by The Daily Tar Heel for Governor Dan K. Moore. A group of UNC students along with Aptheker and Williamson filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court, and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down. In 1968, only a year after its schools became fully integrated, Chapel Hill became the first predominantly white municipality in the country to elect an African American mayor, Howard Lee.

These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many countries were apart of the Holly Alliance?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "",

"nfl_2898": {"passage": "On Monday Night Football, the Bears traveled west to face the 2-6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete. With 1:09 left in the game, Cutler kneeled three times to end the game. With Cutler's touchdown to Bennett, he overtook Sid Luckman for the most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138. Additionally, his final touchdown marked his twelfth fourth quarter touchdown, the most in the league. Miller's touchdown catch was his first since the 2011 season.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many yards was the longest drive?", "answer": {"number": "93", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "0e0838fe-59e5-4eba-982e-f5c288c07e6d"}, {"question": "How many field goals were made?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "6d2d3fae-23b8-465d-a077-bc96a45222cb"}, {"question": "How many losses did the Chargers have coming into this game?", "answer": {"number": "6", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "bef83adc-e892-4e2d-aa85-0182eb33fb01"}, {"question": "How many drives over 80 yards did the Bears have?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "1399b917-e35b-4ff4-9161-391784cc2188"}, {"question": "How many field goals did Lambo kick in the second quarter?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "9a7efb66-329d-43ca-ab74-3a045fa0b07f", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Lambo kick in the first half?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "aa20476c-80ee-49e3-9208-1a6e072419d9", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Gould miss in the third quarter?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "f7adecec-c19b-45e6-824f-4d4d72bb0295", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Lambo kick in the third quarter?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "e5648207-f057-4af2-a4c3-5ebd2a4621e8", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Lambo kick in the second half?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "62daa56d-b2b8-4e9d-97d5-a00737508e8a", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Lambo kick in total?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "81fc1d39-c583-4aa4-a99e-5e80e8c26466", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many total field goals were attempted in the game?", "answer": {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "6e80b689-6574-4b85-8edc-e8170177de1b", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How long were each of Lambo's field goals?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["31-yard", "22-yard"]}, "query_id": "f2744d18-b6bb-4d1e-a254-dbbcbf1c0d04", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many total points were scored during the 2011 matchup?", "answer": {"number": "51", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "650aefcc-9311-4459-8a53-c95f149e5f54", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many times did Cutler turn over the ball in the first half?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "d68b6c71-0a2c-424b-9839-94d3da3f410c", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many touchdowns were scored during the first half?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "fbba27f7-0693-47fd-9f85-425dff0acd84", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Gould miss?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "356127fc-4e7f-40ba-89f5-704c97045a92", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the longest successful field goal?", "answer": {"number": "31", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "79a64e54-b000-4def-9985-c5b0a0383902", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_942": {"passage": "Coming off their home win over the Eagles, the Ravens flew to Paul Brown Stadium for a Week 13 AFC North rematch with the Cincinnati Bengals.

About a thousand POWs, 5 percent of total fatalities, were shot, primarily in escape attempts. Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest. Punishment for escape attempts or serious violations of camp rules included solitary confinement and execution. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, from 18,318 to 19,085 died in Finnish prisoner of war camps. In 1942 the number of prisoner deaths had a negative effect on Finland's international reputation. The Finnish administration decided to improve living conditions and allowed prisoners to work outside their camps. Hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union ceased in September 1944, and the first Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet Union on 15 October 1944. The transfer was complete by the next month. Some of the POWs escaped during the transportation, and some of them were unwilling to return to the Soviet Union.

The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3-0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9. The Steelers moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the victory while the team improved to 3-1.  The team would win their 6th straight game against a divisional opponent. The victory marked the first time that the Steelers defeated the Ravens in Baltimore since 2012.  It would also be Roethlisberger's first win in Baltimore since 2010. Pittsburgh also scored the most points in Baltimore of any Steelers team since 2002.

Staging out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier, a large flotilla of cruisers and destroyers from the United States Seventh Fleet's Task Force 74 escorted the Cebu Attack Group to the island. Under the leadership of Major General William H. Arnold, the forces assigned to the operation consisted of the Americal Division's 132nd and 182nd Infantry Regiments, totaling about 5,000 men, were landed on Cebu island at Talisay Beach, 4 miles  southwest of Cebu City. The 182nd came ashore southwest of the city, while the 132nd landed at a wide gravel beach to the northeast opposite a palm grove. Meeting no Japanese opposition, the U.S. forces nevertheless suffered heavily from mines and booby traps as they crossed the beach.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What happened in conjunction with Operation Victor II?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["the battle for Cebu City"]}, "query_id": "ca13af13-be80-447d-80ce-43acaebcb9f5"}, {"question": "When were the rehearsal landings?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "24", "month": "March", "year": "1945"}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "c65820f2-3101-4e14-a5da-a6f48f9f777b"}, {"question": "what month was operation Victor II launched?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "March", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b6046cba-e080-4858-b2a0-bb30d32f1dda"}, {"question": "What large vehicles had a rehearsal landing?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["flotilla of cruisers", "destroyers"]}, "query_id": "c1a8bbcb-eedb-49f0-a246-52ef54e97d60"}, {"question": "where were these large vehicles from", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["United States"]}, "query_id": "1185028a-f32d-4c23-b189-85a2d4f91493"}, {"question": "When did the Allies conduct rehearsal landings in Leyte?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "24", "month": "March", "year": "1945"}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "c6c00286-5a1c-4272-b456-624bf72dfe08", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many infantry regiments did Major General William H.

There was a tendency for population, fortifications and raiding to shift south from Moscow and east from the Polish/Ukrainian area. After 1648 we are dealing with large armies - Tatars, Turks, Poles, Russians and large numbers of Ukrainian Cossacks. Most fighting was in the western Ukraine . This drove the Slavic population to the Left Bank and probably allowed Russian population to expand southward north of Ukraine. Fighting weakened the Polish Commonwealth, but Russia continued to grow southward until it annexed Crimea in 1783. Note that this list does not include raids before 1480, raids further east, most Cossack raids on Crimea and petty raiding between different groups of Nogais, which was considerable. The main underlying theme of the period is the southward expansion of Russian population and the eastward expansion of Ukrainian population. If we had population figures for this the history of the period would be much clearer.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many years after raids were well into the Polish Ukraine as far as Belarus did Russia annex Crimea?", "answer": {"number": "276", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "d3505ec7-e63a-4c0f-ad9b-bad2862e23c8", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "history_777": {"passage": "On 22 December the Pretender landed in Scotland at Peterhead, but by the time he arrived at Perth on 9 January 1716, the Jacobite army numbered fewer than 5,000.

On 30 January Mar led the Jacobites out of Perth; on 4 February the Pretender wrote a farewell letter to Scotland, sailing from Montrose the following day. Many Jacobites who were taken prisoner were tried for treason and sentenced to death. The Indemnity Act of July 1717 pardoned all those who had taken part in the Rising, but the whole of the Clan Gregor, including Rob Roy MacGregor, was specifically excluded from the benefits of that Act. Another attempt, this time with Spanish support, was undertaken in 1719, only to end again in defeat in the Battle of Glenshiel.

Arbanon had long been an autonomous principality within Epirus, and the Nicaean conquest around 1255 was resented. The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor Constantine Chabaron. The rebels were active in Durr\u00eb, Ohrid, Debar and Mat. The Nicaean forces were under the command of George Akropolites, who described the events himself in his history. In the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left Thessaloniki and by way of Kastoria entered Kounavia, Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, Michael II, and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in Kanina. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to Prilep and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos. The most decisive battle was fought in the city of Devol.

With the exception of a playoff loss in 2005, the Bears had won every meeting at Soldier Field. Jeff Joniak stressed a run-heavy offense; although the Panthers had not allowed a 100-yard rusher nor 100-yard receiver in 2017, the lack of linebacker Luke Kuechly weakened the Panthers defense. Furthermore, Jordan Howard was averaging 2.1 yards per carry, while his 245 rushing yards after contact was the second-highest in the league behind the Kansas City Chiefs' Kareem Hunt. For the defense, the unit needed to contain Cam Newton by preventing the scramble-skilled quarterback from running, while also dealing with Kelvin Benjamin, Christian McCaffrey, and Ed Dickson. The Bears started the game on a strong note when Newton's pitch to Curtis Samuel was dropped and recovered by Eddie Jackson, who returned the fumble for a 75-yard touchdown. The next three drives ended with punts, with Chicago's next series stalling after Mitchell Trubisky was sacked for a nine-yard loss on Carolina's 25-yard line. Connor Barth's 52-yard field goal attempt was partially blocked by Kawann Short and hit the crossbar. On the Panthers' following possession, Newton's pass for Benjamin was broken up by Prince Amukamara and intercepted by Jackson, resulting in a 76-yard pick six. Graham Gano kicked a 36-yard field goal, which the Bears responded with Trubisky's 70-yard pass to Tarik Cohen to set the offense up at the five-yard line. Howard's two carries were stopped, while Trubisky's touchdown run on third down was overturned as he was down before crossing the goal line. This resulted in 19-yarder by Barth to make the score 17-3 at halftime. In the second half, neither team was able to score as all but two drives concluded with a punt: on the Panthers' first series of the second half, Newton's attempt to run on fourth down and two was stopped by Eddie Goldman, while in the fourth quarter, Danny Trevathan intercepted a pass by Newton. The victory marked Chicago's second consecutive win, the first time the Bears had done so since November 2015. Jackson's two scores made him the first player in NFL history to record two defensive touchdowns of at least 75 yards in a game; as a whole, the defense excelled as it sacked Newton a season-high five times and forced three turnovers. In contrast to the defensive success, the offense was restricted to just five first downs and 153 total yards, while converting just two of eleven third down situations. In the second half, the offense was forced to punt on four straight drives and ended the day having allowed four total sacks. Trubisky completed just four of seven passes, making him the first quarterback since the 2011 Denver Broncos' Tim Tebow to win a game while completing less than five passes; coincidentally, Tebow's head coach was also John Fox. While coaching the Panthers in 2006, Fox's team defeated the Falcons as quarterback Chris Weinke also completed four of seven passes.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "The field goal that hit the crossbar was kicked by who?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Connor Barth"]}, "query_id": "61236bd8-5705-4254-ad11-a4648fc3ad79"}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "history_317": {"passage": "The City of Charleston Police Department, with a total of 458 sworn officers, 117 civilians, and 27 reserve police officers, is South Carolina's largest police department.

In the years 1905-1906 close to 7,000 strikes and other work stoppages occurred, involving 1,3 million Poles. Protesters demanded both improved conditions for workers and more political freedom for the Poles. By February, students at Polish universities had joined the demonstrations, protesting russification and demanding the right to study in Polish language. They were joined by high school students and even some from the elementary schools.

The most notable example of this is the Bekir Pasha Aqueduct, built under the auspices of Ebubekir Pasha between 1746 and 1748. This aqueduct supplied fresh water to Larnaca and prior to its construction, local residents had to carry water on their backs for two hours. Silihtar aqueduct, built between 1801 and 1803, and the Arab Ahmet aqueduct supplied water to Nicosia. The authorities also encouraged the construction and improvement of artificial channels for water supply and irrigation, which greatly increased crop yield and allowed large-scale fruit production. Among villages described as prosperous due to artificial irrigation upon the British takeover of the island are Morphou, Lapithos, Polis, Lefka, Avdimou and Kolossi. Samuel Baker, who visited Cyprus in 1879, noted \"mills turned by water\" and \"narrow lanes streaming with water\" in Lefka. He also wrote that \"every garden and farm was irrigated by water conducted from the mountains in artificial channels\" in the northern slopes of the Kyrenia Mountains extending to the Karpas Peninsula. In Karavas, streams were diverted into artificial channels to supply water to the village. In the 19th century, a major effort was undertaken by a series of Ottoman governors to straighten and regulate the course of the Pedieos. Edhem Pasha, who served as governor in the 1840s, completed the construction of the Larnaca-Nicosia road and several bridges.

However, Buss was also unhappy with the Lakers offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the Westhead\u2013Johnson altercation, but assistant GM Jerry West and GM Bill Sharman had convinced Buss to delay his decision. Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 9.5 assists, and a league-high 2.7 steals per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team. He also joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to tally at least 700 points, 700 rebounds, and 700 assists in the same season.

By the 1530s, the old powers had been or were being eclipsed by upstart powers. In Upper Burma, the Mohnyin-led Confederation of Shan States finally finished off Ava in 1527. On the western coast, the Kingdom of Mrauk U was ascendant at the expense of a weak Bengal, extending its reach into the Ganges Delta in 1533. In the south, the Taungoo-Hanthawaddy War  resulted in a Hanthawaddy victory in 1538-39, and Martaban in 1541, giving the men from the small frontier outpost total control of Lower Burma. Taungoo's meteoric rise raised alarm amongst other powers. In 1539, Ava  and Mrauk U entered into an alliance to defend Ava's vassal state of Prome. But their poorly coordinated forces could not stop better organized Taungoo forces from taking over Prome  in 1542. After his army's crushing defeat at Padaung Pass, King Min Bin of Mrauk U left the alliance. Convinced that Taungoo's guns would eventually point toward his kingdom, Min Bin beefed up the already formidable defenses around his capital. In the following three years, Taungoo completed its takeover of central Burma up to Bagan, which Ava formally ceded in exchange for peace in 1545.

On 30 May 1568, a dismayed Bayinnaung sent an army of 6,000 to reinforce the defences at Phitsanulok, whose ruler had remained loyal to him. Phitsanulok withstood the siege by joint Siamese and Lan Xang forces till October when the besiegers withdrew to avoid what was to come. On 27 November 1568, 55,000-strong Burmese armies arrived at Phitsanulok. Reinforced at Phitsanulok, combined armies of 70,000 marched down to Ayutthaya, and laid siege to the city in December 1568. A month into the siege, Maha Chakkraphat died, and was succeeded by Mahin in January 1564. Setthathirath tried to break the siege but his army was severely defeated northeast of the city on 23 April 1569. Mahin finally offered to surrender but the offer was not accepted. The city finally fell on 8 August 1569. Bayinnaung appointed Maha Thammaracha, the viceroy of Phitsanulok, as vassal king on 30 September 1569.

In the second quarter, the 49ers tied the game up with RB Frank Gore getting a 1-yard TD run.  The Rams would respond with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 27 and a 29-yard field goal.

His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness.

Later more units were sent from Russia. The soviets also recruited partisan groups behind the front lines. Soviet soldiers were poorly supplied and had to support themselves by requisitioning food, horses, and clothes from local residents. Lithuania could not offer serious resistance as at the time its army consisted only of about 3,000 untrained volunteers. Only local partisans, armed with weapons acquired from retreating Germans, offered brief resistance. Red Army captured one town after another: Zarasai and \u0160ven\u010dionys , Utena , Roki\u0161kis , Vilnius , Ukmerg\u0117 and Panev\u0117\u017eys , \u0160iauliai , Tel\u0161iai . That accounted for about \u2154 of the Lithuanian territory. The front somewhat stabilized when Soviet forces were stopped near the Venta River by Latvian and German units . Also Germans slowed down withdrawal of their troops after the Spartacist uprising was subdued on January 12. Southern Lithuania was a little better protected as Germans retreated from Ukraine through Hrodna. To prevent fights between retreating Germans and the Red Army, the Soviets and Germans signed a treaty on January 18. The treaty drew a temporary demarcation line that went through Daugai, Stakli\u0161k\u0117s, and 10 kilometres  east of Kai\u0161iadorys-Jonava-K\u0117dainiai railway.

In that year a group helped the Dutch corsair Baltazar de Cordes attack the Spanish settlement of Castro. Unlike in continental Chile, the indigenous population of Chilo\u00e9 grew from 1700 onwards. By 1712 indigenous peoples made up around 50% of the population of the archipelago. The encomiendas of Chilo\u00e9 were the largest of Chile and the administration of this form of labor more abusive than on the mainland. Moreover, the encomenderos did not fulfill their obligations; they did not register tribute nor salaries. Encomenderos often did not pay legal salaries or salaries at all and did not observe the \"free time\" of Indians in the encomienda laws. The encomienda activities in Chilo\u00e9 included the Indians traveling to the continental coast to log for alerce wood. In retrospect, the Huilliches considered the abuses of Jos\u00e9 de Andrade a trigger of the rebellion, one of his abuses in particular: the whipping of Mart\u00edn Antucan, an Indian he tied to an apple tree and to then flogged his genitals with nettles to be then covered in tow and set afire. According to testimonies gathered in 1725 Jos\u00e9 de Andrade judged wrongdoings himself, did not pay salaries and tortured those who did not work due to illness. His son is reported to have had similar behaviors and his majordomo kidnapped children to send them to continental Chile.

From September 1-15, 1865, the Powder River Expedition (1865) battled Native Americans in the Powder River Battles (1865) near the future site of Broadus. On March 17, 1876, the Battle of Powder River occurred in the south-central part of the county, about  southwest of Broadus. In June 1876 six companies of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (United States) led by Major Marcus Reno marched along the Powder River nearly to the mouth of the Little Powder before turning west toward the Battle of Little Bighorn. On November 1, 1878, Powderville, Montana became the first establishment in the county, as the Powder River Telegraph Station, on the Fort Keogh to Deadwood, South Dakota telegraph line. On April 5, 1879, the Mizpah Creek Incidents began near the Powderville telegraph station in the extreme northern part of the county. In the early 1880s, a large area of Southeastern Montana became Custer County, Montana, including the present area encompassed by Powder River County. In February 1900, the Broadus post office was established, named after the Broaddus family. In October 1918, publication of a newspaper, the Broadus Independent (now called the Powder River Examiner), began in Broadus, and is still published today.

Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.

They were first subjugated by one of Urs\u00faa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpet\u00e9n, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet\u00e9n.

On 3rd-and-3 at the Patriots 34, Cam Newton threw an incomplete pass, but Aqib Talib was flagged for unnecessary roughness. This moved the ball to the 19 and gave Carolina a new set of downs. A few plays later, Newton hit eventual Patriot Brandon LaFell for a 9-yard touchdown. The Patriots responded by driving to the 13-yard line of Carolina, but Stevan Ridley fumbled after being tackled by Kawann Short with Mario Addison recovering for Carolina. The Patriots had taken 6:41 off the clock, but had come away with zero points. Carolina responded by driving 63 yards to the Patriots 25-yard line, taking 6:01 off the clock, and Graham Gano drilled a 42-yard field goal, extending the lead to 10-0 with only 5:02 remaining in the half. The Patriots drove 42 yards to the Carolina 24, but Carolina's stout defense held the Patriots to only a field goal as Gostkowski drained a 42-year field goal with 1:09 remaining in the half. Carolina ran out the clock going to the locker room up 10&#8212;3, but Brady led New England back on another second-half comeback. The Patriots took the opening drive of the half for a touchdown marching 82 yards in only 8 plays with Brady throwing a short pass to Rob Gronkowski who carried three Carolina defenders into the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown, tying the score at 10-10. The Panthers responded immediately with an amazing 13 play, 81 yard drive, including 3 3rd-down conversions. On 3rd-and-7 at the Carolina 37, Cam Newton beat the Patriots blitz with a 14-yard scramble. Later on 3rd-and-1 at the Patriots 40, Mike Tolbert ran for 2 yards and finally, on 3rd-and-4 at the Patriots 15, Newton connected with Greg Olsen for a 15-yard touchdown retaking the lead 17-10. The Patriots answered right back driving 80 yards using only 9 plays with Ridley redeeming himself with a 1-yard touchdown run tying the game at 17-17. After a Panthers three-and-out the Patriots drove 30 yards to the Panthers 8-yard line, but the Panthers defense stood strong and held the Patriots to a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots their lead at 20-17 with 6:32 remaining in the game. However, Cam Newton led the Panthers down the field on a 13 play, 83 yard drive that took 5:33 off the clock and retook the lead at 24&#8212;20 with only&#160;:59 seconds left. Once again the Panthers converted 3 3rd-downs. On 3rd-and-6 at the Carolina 21, Newton ran for 15 yards. On 3rd-and-2 at the Carolina 44, Newton ran for 3 more yards. Finally, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 36, Devin McCourty was flagged for a questionable pass interference on Greg Olsen. Newton finished the drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on 2nd-and-15. On the Patriots final drive,  Brady threw three straight incompletions to start the drive. On 4th-and-10, Brady connected with Gronkowski for 23 yards to the Patriots 43. After an incomplete pass, Brady fired an 11-yard pass to Danny Amendola to the Panthers 46. Four plays later Brady threw an incomplete pass intended for Aaron Dobson on 3rd-and-10, but Melvin White was called for pass interference, moving the ball to the Panthers 36. A 7-yard completion to Dobson an 11-yard completion to Shane Vereen moved the ball to the 18-yard line with&#160;:03 seconds left. On the last play Brady threw a pass to Rob Gronkowski, but was intercepted in the end zone by Robert Lester. However, yet another controversial call by the referees decided the outcome of the game, as the Panther's Luke Kuechly was called for pass interference on Gronkowski, but the flag was picked up and announced there was no foul due to the ball being \"uncatchable\", nullifying the penalty and resulting in end of the game.

The famine of 1740-41 was due to extremely cold and then rainy weather in successive years, resulting in food losses in three categories: a series of poor grain harvests, a shortage of milk, and frost damage to potatoes. At this time, grains, particularly oats, were more important than potatoes as staples in the diet of most workers. Deaths from mass starvation in 1740-41 were compounded by an outbreak of fatal diseases. The cold and its effects extended across Europe, but mortality was higher in Ireland because both grain and potatoes failed. This is now considered by scholars to be the last serious cold period at the end of the Little Ice Age of about 1400-1800. By the mid-19th century's better-known Great Famine of 1845-1852, potatoes made up a greater portion of the Irish diets, with adverse consequences when the crops failed.

the north, the Khmer Empire of Angkor Wat to the east and the Malay States to the south. King Intharacha of Ayutthaya forced the former Kingdom of Sukhothai to recognize his authority in 1410. The king then invaded Lan Na in 1411, seizing Chiang Rai but failing to capture Chiang Mai and Phayao. In the latter battle the two sides may have used early cannons. In 1424 King Borommarachathirat II ascended the throne of Ayutthaya. After a seven-month siege, he captured Angkor by treachery in 1431. The Khmer retook the city in 1432 and subsequently transferred their capital to Phnom Penh.

The Eagles held the Patriots to 0 points in the first quarter, but Brady threw a touchdown to James White on the first play of the 2nd quarter, followed by an 11-yard strike to Danny Amendola to make the game 14-0. New England tried an onside kick to surprise Philadelphia, but the special teams were ready and recovered it, giving the Eagles ideal field position. Bradford took advantage of this with a 5-yard touchdown to Zach Ertz next drive, but could not get going following the drive. With 15 seconds left, New England looked poised to end the half with a 7-point lead, but Chris Maragos blocked a punt that middle linebacker Najee Goode took back 24 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Brady drove the ball to the five yard line, but free safety Malcolm Jenkins had other plans, catching an interception and running it back for a 100-yard pick six. Next drive, New England was forced to punt, which Darren Sproles took back 83 yards for a touchdown. Next drive, Brady threw an end zone pick to cornerback Byron Maxwell, who went down in the end zone for a touchback. In a drive set up by Maxwell's INT that lasted well into the fourth quarter, Bradford threw a TD to Jordan Matthews, and the Eagles were leading 35-14. Enraged fans started to leave the stadium, but soon the lead would thicken as the Patriots scored, recovered an onside kick, and scored again, turning things to make the score 35-28 with 3 minutes left. Riley Cooper batted the next onside kick out of bounds to secure the Eagles possession. After 3rd string running back Kenjon Barner fumbled with slightly over a minute left, Tom Brady and the undermanned Patriots' offense attempted to rally to tie the game, but dropped passes by Martin and Amendola ultimately lead to the underdog Eagles stunning New England and its home crowd. Although Bradford posted very few yards, he threw 2 touchdowns and continued to not turn the ball over. Outside linebackers Connor Barwin and Brandon Graham scored 2 sacks each. DeMarco Murray returned to his shape from weeks 1-4, rushing for 24 yards on 8 carries, which turns into a pitiful 7 carries for 5 yards when you take away his longest run of 19 yards. Darren Sproles stepped up, rushing for 66 yards, receiving for 34 yards, and returning punts for 115 yards and 1 touchdown. With the win, the Eagles go to 5-7, ending a three-game skid and passing the Giants for second place in the NFC East. With a loss by the Washington Redskins, the Eagles' 5-7 record tied them with the Redskins for the best record in the NFC East, but their Week 4 loss kept them in second.

However, his debut season with the Oilers was not the dream he imagined, as injuries limited him to only 26 games played. Already recovering from a shoulder injury when he entered training camp, Souray played through it, but reinjured the shoulder just six games into the season in a fight, and missed the next 55 games. But in 2008-09 NHL season, he bounced back from the injury-shortened campaign to record 23 goals and 53 points and once again become an 57th National Hockey League All-Star Game. He finished third in the hardest shot competition that year, clocking in at 102.3 mph, behind Shea Weber (103.4) of the Nashville Predators, and winner Zdeno Ch\u00e1ra (105.4) of the Boston Bruins. But during the Oilers own 2009 Skills Competition, on January 4, Souray set the then-unofficial NHL record for the hardest shot. Clocked at 106.7 mph, his slapshot beat Chad Kilgers old unofficial record of 106.6 mph set at the Toronto Maple Leafs 2006 Skills Competition. The record was deemed unofficial, however, as the League does not recognize individual team Skills Competitions and instead goes by the National Hockey League All-Star Games Skills Competition results. Sourays unofficial shot was not surpassed until January 28, 2012, by Ch\u00e1ra, whose 108.8 mph slapshot in the Skills Competition preceding the 59th National Hockey League All-Star Game beat Sourays blast and set the official record. Souray also earned a humorous nickname during his strong 2008-09 season, when during the third period of a 5-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on December 3, 2008, the Stars broadcast team referred to Souray as the \"Studly Wonderbomb\" as a recognition of his slapshots prowess.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Which players recorded slap shots above 105 mph?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Zdeno Ch\u00e1ra", "Souray", "Chad Kilgers"]}, "query_id": "51ac191d-18c1-46c6-a56e-af2c27f77788", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_1928": {"passage": "The Vikings returned to the Metrodome in Week 3 for the first time since their 2009 Divisional Play-off to take on the Seattle Seahawks.

Patriots 41-14 on Monday Night Football. The Patriots struggling offensive line combined with Brady's accuracy issues doomed them against Tamba Hali and Justin Houston while the Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs balanced offensive attack. The Chiefs had a strong opening possession, reaching the Patriots 46, but were forced to punt. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Chiefs struck with 11-play, 73-yard drive, with Jamaal Charles scoring on a 2-yard touchdown run. The Patriots managed to reach the Chiefs 42-yard line on their next drive but were once again forced to punt. On the Chiefs' next possession, Knile Davis powered his way for a 48-yard carry to the Patriots 38-yard line. Next, Alex Smith hit star tight-end Travis Kelce on a 33-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 5-yard line. Finally, Smith hit Charles for a five-yard touchdown pass, extending the Chiefs lead to 14-0. The Patriots once again drove into Chiefs' territory on their next drive, but again punted away. Later, the Chiefs drove all the way to the Patriots 4-yard line, and Smith hit Dwayne Bowe at the Patriots 1-yard line, which should have ended the half, but Logan Ryan was called for a hands-to-the face on Donnie Avery, allowing one more play, and Cairo Santos booted a 22-yard chip-shot field goal for a 17-0 Chiefs lead at halftime. The Chiefs had gained 303 yards of offense in the first half, the most allowed in one half by the Patriots under Belichick. Both teams punted on their initial second-half possession, but on 2nd and 7 on the Patriots' next possession, Tamba Hali, almost completely untouched by left tackle Nate Solder, strip-sacked Brady and recovered for Kansas City at the Patriots 9. Two plays later, Smith threw a quick pass to Charles out of the backfield for a touchdown, Charles' third, increasing Kansas City's lead to 24-0. On the Patriots' second play of their next drive, a miscommunication between Brady and Edelman led to an interception by Sean Smith who returned the ball 34 yards to the New England 13 yard line. The Patriots defense managed to keep Kansas City out of the end zone, but Santos booted a 31-yard field goal, giving Kansas City a 27-0 lead. On the Patriots next drive, Vereen ran for 9 yards on 1st down. After being stuffed for no gain on the next play, Brady hit Vereen for a 28-yard gain to the Chiefs 44. On the very next play, Brady hit Brandon LaFell who broke through three defenders and raced off for a 44-yard touchdown, making the score 27-7. However, the Chiefs couldn't be stopped. Kansas City answered right back, marching 80 yards in 12 plays, converting two third-and-longs in the process, and scoring on Smith's two-yard touchdown strike to Kelce extending the lead to 34-7, and killing any hope of a Patriots comeback. On the ensuing Patriots drive, facing a 3rd-and-4 from their own 26, Husain Abdullah intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 41-7 lead. Abdullah fell to his knees in a Muslim prayer, and was flagged for unnecessary roughness. This caused controversy as many thought it was for his praying. With the deficit an insurmountable 41-7, Brady was benched and rookie Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in. Garoppolo completed 3 passes on the drive: a 5-yard pass to Edelman, a 37-yard screen to LaFell, then a 13-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, for a 41-14 score. After both teams punted, the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. Jamaal Charles was the main weapon of the Chiefs' offense, totaling 108 yards from scrimmage (92 rushing, 16 receiving) and three touchdowns. Knile Davis ran the ball 16 times for 107 yards. Alex Smith was 20/26 for 236 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. The Chiefs forced three turnovers and converted them into 17 points while committing no turnovers themselves. Brady completed 14 of 23 passes for a pedestrian 159 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions while being sacked 3 times. Brandon LaFell was the sole offensive star for the Patriots, catching 6 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown.  The 27 point margin of defeat represented the second largest loss for the Patriots in the Bill Belichick era (the Patriots' worst loss was a 31-point loss (31-0) to the Bills in Week 1 of the 2003 season). With the loss, the Patriots' record dropped to 2-2. In his regular press conference the ensuing Wednesday, when asked about the loss (primarily by Albert Breer) he replied with his now famous line, \"We're on to Cincinnati\". The Patriots would proceed to win ten of their final twelve regular season games, clinch the #1 seed, win the AFC Championship, and win the Super Bowl, making that quote a piece of Patriots lore. Following their Super Bowl victory over the Seahawks, several Patriots players, including Brady himself, pointed to this game as the turning point in the Patriots season.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many yards was the scoring drive that ended in a 2-yard Jamaal Charles touchdown?", "answer": {"number": "73", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "cf6f4438-61c7-4450-9c5a-c955dd84e3ac"}, {"question": "Who replaced Tom Brady?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Jimmy Garoppolo"]}, "query_id": "eb7bf0af-a27c-4c40-a805-973eeef36ef4"}, {"question": "How many points did The Chiefs win by?", "answer": {"number": "27", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "997d0ee2-7cf7-49c3-b033-956f9ca6b4d9"}, {"question": "Which played scored the most touchdowns?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Jamaal Charles"]}, "query_id": "de34a417-90fe-4352-a92e-5337947f3e19"}, {"question": "Who scored the first TD for New England?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Brandon LaFell"]}, "query_id": "fdac3fe4-60ef-49b0-b572-23b6de7b8f17"}, {"question": "Which player had the most rushing yards?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Knile Davis"]}, "query_id": "5ca9202a-054f-4470-a751-115c47d3af12"}, {"question": "How many more passes did Smith complete than Brady?", "answer": {"number": "6", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "93bbca40-ad11-4090-b530-a3b1c06b2e68"}, {"question": "How many yards difference exists between Cairo Santos's longest and shortest field goal? ?", "answer": {"number": "9", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "5b819705-2ef7-4850-8fa7-00fb812895d5", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How long were each of Jamaal Charles's first two touchdowns?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["2-yard", "five-yard"]}, "query_id": "39ae5cfa-1c26-404e-8df0-398c7ca1234e", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards longer was Santos' second field goal than his first?", "answer": {"number": "9", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "cd9725e9-bfde-425e-acba-ab90bb447714", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards were all Santos' field goals combined?", "answer": {"number": "53", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "99bb2468-5e87-44bd-bb42-e3be163dafae", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many incomplete passes did Smith throw?", "answer": {"number": "6", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "cfc00070-4062-4973-a483-386179e98780", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more touchdowns did Charles score than LaFell?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "2c202089-5199-4b8d-8043-80ee804c68d2", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many passes did Brady and Garoppolo complete combined?", "answer": {"number": "17", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "8be1f456-3e68-4136-8958-df8c33beaf25", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the second longest field goal?", "answer": {"number": "22", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "01654b13-75d7-41c0-a069-5657e8616848", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards longer was the second touchdown than the first?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "f2eb4b59-57e7-4987-b1d7-b672001dafc0", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more passes did Smith throw than Brady?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "63292d91-b545-4744-9722-e76d4abce646", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_2988": {"passage": "After a Titans three-and-out, the Patriots put together an 11 play, 79-yard drive, with Brady hitting Gronkowski on a 5-yard touchdown pass.

The Company benefited from a large investment in capital, drawing on the enthusiasm of the best financiers and capitalists of the Republic, such as Isaac de Pinto, by origin a Portuguese Jew. The Dutch West India Company would not, however, be as successful as its eastern counterpart. The Dutch invasion began in 1624 with the conquest of the then capital of the State of Brazil, the city of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia, but the Dutch conquest was short lived. In 1625, a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet of 52 ships and 12,000 men rapidly recaptured Salvador. In 1630 the Dutch returned, and captured Olinda and then Recife, renamed Mauritsstadt, thus establishing the colony of New Holland. The Portuguese commander Matias de Albuquerque retreated his forces inland, to establish a camp dubbed Arraial do Bom Jesus. Until 1635, the Dutch were unable to harvest sugar due to Portuguese guerrilla attacks, and were virtually confined to the walled perimeter of the cities. Eventually, the Dutch evicted the Portuguese with the assistance of a local landlord named Domingos Fernandes Calabar, but on his retreat to Bahia, Matias de Albuquerque captured Calabar at Porto Calvo, and had him hang for treason. The Portuguese fought back two Dutch attacks on Bahia in 1638.

Ahmed Kutty composed the Malabar Lahala enna Khilafat Patt in 1925, which describes the events of the rebellion. Many of rebel prisoners such as Tannirkode Ossankoya composed songs in their letters to relatives. The rebellion triggered the development of Mygurudu, a Malayalam-based secret language.

The first leg, held in Rotterdam a month earlier, finished 0\u20130. Despite Feijenoord eventually losing the match 3\u20131, this turned out to be the start of the most successful period in the clubs history. Feijenoord won the double for the first time in their history in 1965, and managed to win another double a few years later in 1969. The 1965 title secured Feijenoord a spot in the 1965\u201366 European Cup, where they faced multiple cup champion Real Madrid C.F. on 8 September 1965. During the match, Hans Kraay had to leave the pitch injured after 31 minutes, without being substituted. He returned at the start of the second half and scored the goal which resulted in a 2\u20131 win. During the match, fans favourite Coen Moulijn was attacked by a Spanish defender. Moulijn then proceeded to chase the defender down the pitch, leading other players, and even fans who entered the pitch, to do the same. The referee could do nothing but to suspend the match at 2\u20131 in Feijenoords favour.

First in June 1954 as elements of Operation Passage to Freedom and then two years later to map and survey the nations roads. Seabee teams 501 and 502 arrived on 25 Jan 1963 and are regarded as the first Seabees of the Vietnam conflict. They were sent to Dam Pau and Tri Ton to build camps for the Special Forces. In June 1965, Construction Mechanic 3rd Class Marvin Glenn Shields was a member of Seabee Technical Assistance Team 1104, that took part in the Battle of Dong Xoai. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions there and is the only Seabee ever to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Those Seabee \"Civic Action Teams\" continued throughout the Vietnam War and often were fending off enemy forces alongside their Marine and Army counterparts. Teams typically built schools, clinics or drilled wells. In 1964 ACB 1 was the first CB in the theatre. Beginning in 1965 Naval Construction Regiments (NCRs) deployed throughout Vietnam. The Seabees supported the Marines by building a staggering number of aircraft-support facilities, roads, and bridges. Seabees also worked with and taught construction skills to the Vietnamese people. In 1968 the Marine Corps requested that the Navy make a name change to the CBs. The Marines were using \"MCB\" for Marine Corps Base and the Navy was using \"MCB\" for Mobile Construction Battalions. The Navy then added \"Naval\" to MCB creating the NMCBs that now exist. In May 1968 two reserve battalions were activated (RNMCBs 12 and 22) which brought the total number of battalions rotating to Vietnam to 21 (not including ACBs 1 and 2 or the two Construction Battalion Maintenance Units (CBMUs) that were there too). During 1969 the total number of Seabees that had deployed topped out at 29,000 and then their draw-down began. The last battalion withdrew the end of 1971 which left 3 Seabee teams.

After the Egyptians withdrew from the Yemeni seaboard in 1841, Haj Ali Shermerki, a successful and ambitious Somali merchant, purchased from them executive rights over Zeila. Shermerki's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he manoeuvred to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden. Shermerki was later succeeded as Governor of Zeila by Abu Bakr Pasha, a local Afar statesman. In 1874-75, the Egyptians obtained a firman from the Ottomans by which they secured claims over the city. At the same time, the Egyptians received British recognition of their nominal jurisdiction as far east as Cape Guardafui. In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years . The British Somaliland protectorate was subsequently established in the late 1880s, after the ruling Somali authorities signed a series of protection treaties granting the British access to their territories on the northwestern coast. Among the Somali signatories were the Gadabuursi , Habar Awal , and Warsangali. When the Egyptian garrison in Harar was eventually evacuated in 1885, Zeila became caught up in the competition between the Tadjoura-based French and the British for control of the strategic Gulf of Aden littoral. By the end of 1885, the two powers were on the brink of armed confrontation, but opted instead to turn negotiations.

Their forces were suffering from desertions, and the presence of royalist artillery would make Torrelobat\u00f3n's castle vulnerable.

He delayed his decision until the early hours of April 23, losing considerable time and allowing the royalists to unite their forces in Pe\u00f1aflor. The combined royalist army pursued the comuneros. Again, the royalists had a strong advantage in cavalry, with their army consisting of 6,000 infantry and 2,400 cavalry against Padilla's 7,000 infantry and 400 cavalry.  Heavy rain slowed Padilla's infantry more than the royalist cavalry and rendered the primitive firearms of the rebels' 1,000 arquebusiers nearly useless.  Padilla hoped to reach the relative safety of Toro and the heights of Vega de Valdetronco, but his infantry was too slow.  He gave battle with the harrying royalist cavalry at the town of Villalar.  The cavalry charges scattered the rebel ranks, and the battle became a slaughter.  There were an estimated 500-1,000 rebel casualties and many desertions. The three most important leaders of the rebellion were captured: Juan de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and Francisco Maldonado.  They were beheaded the next morning in the Plaza of Villalar, with a large portion of the royalist nobility present.
