Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Rye was cultivated by at least 11,050 BC. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer wheat and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, Vicia ervilia, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung bean, soy and Azuki bean beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some List of root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. Agriculture in Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China.

The PRC refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC, but does not object to nations conducting economic, cultural, and other such exchanges with Taiwan that do not imply diplomatic relation. Therefore, many nations that have diplomatic relations with Beijing maintain quasi-diplomatic offices in Taipei. Similarly, the government in Taiwan maintains quasi-diplomatic offices in most nations under various names, most commonly as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "In which years did the United Nations General Assembly pass resolutions concerning the Republic of China?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["1 February 1952", "25 October 1971"]}, "query_id": "73b76fa3-a6b6-4d65-a1d5-94f2ec5841ce"}, {"question": "What has kept the Republic of China from rejoining the UN?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC"]}, "query_id": "04dcb8c8-f5f6-4d05-bf30-893865cc2843"}, {"question": "How many years did these events span for?", "answer": {"number": "21", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b19edc81-1b79-4122-a5da-e533a7c84741"}, {"question": "What happened first, resolution 2758 being passed, or United Nationals General Assembly Resolution 505 being passed?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["passed on 1 February 1952", "Resolution 505,"]}, "query_id": "d671d33c-ea80-49ee-9288-dd102f3de789"}, {"question": "What happened first, Israeli government recognized the PRC or Resolution 2758 was passed?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Israeli government recognized the PRC"]}, "query_id": "4c23e7f2-49f7-4d99-bf61-83b66fbc118c"}, {"question": "What does PRC stand for?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["People's Republic of China"]}, "query_id": "522fbf66-6732-424f-a874-277590488600"}, {"question": "Who rebelled", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Chinese communists"]}, "query_id": "97259da6-55af-4750-b755-99687989ccbe"}, {"question": "Who did not like the ROC", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["The PRC"]}, "query_id": "957a8658-df43-4948-8cf5-d3210f48bdea"}, {"question": "How many months after the Israeli government extended recognition to the People's Republic of China did the United Nations Generally Assembly Resolution 505 pass?", "answer": {"number": "25", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "ba534113-3175-4aaa-9194-a735b6b0888a"}, {"question": "How many years after Resolution 505 passed, did Resolution 2758 pass?", "answer": {"number": "19", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "4f938e34-193e-4b63-870f-192d6e86140f"}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_1806": {"passage": "Coming off their bye week, the Browns went home for their Week 9 intraconference duel with the New England Patriots.

First, quarterback Trevor Siemian connected with wide receiver Jordan Taylor on a 14-yard touchdown pass. The touchdown was initially ruled as an incomplete pass, but overturned by a replay challenge. Following an interception of Saints' quarterback Drew Brees by cornerback Darian Stewart, placekicker Brandon McManus added a 50-yard field goal early in the second quarter. The Broncos were attempting to add to their lead just before halftime, however Siemian was intercepted by cornerback Sterling Moore, and the Saints quickly advanced 50 yards in only 29 seconds, culminating in a 30-yard field goal by placekicker Will Lutz. Early in the third quarter, the Saints tied the game, with Brees connecting with wide receiver Willie Snead on a 3-yard touchdown pass. On the Broncos' second possession of the second half, Siemian was intercepted by safety Kenny Vaccaro, and four plays later, another touchdown pass from Brees to Snead from 5 yards out gave the Saints a 17-10 lead. On the Broncos next drive, McManus missed wide left on a 42-yard field attempt early in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Saints' next possession, Broncos' cornerback Bradley Roby forced a fumble off wide receiver Michael Thomas, which was recovered by Stewart at the Saints' 27-yard line. Seven plays later, the Broncos tied the game, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Siemian to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. After forcing the Saints to go three-and-out, the Broncos drove down the field, but had to settle on a 28-yard field goal by McManus. The Broncos' defense forced another fumble deep in Saints' territory, but had to settle on a 37-yard field goal by McManus with 2:50 remaining in the game, while forcing the Saints to burn the last two of their three team timeouts. The Saints then drove 75 yards in only six plays, culminating in Brees throwing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandin Cooks to tie the game at 23-23 with 1:30 remaining in the game. However, Lutz's extra point attempt was blocked by Justin Simmons, and Will Parks scooped up the football and ran to the end zone for a defensive two-point conversion. The Saints claimed that Parks may have stepped out of bounds, but the initial ruling on the field was upheld after an instant replay review. The Saints' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Broncos.

As the war chest was empty, Eugene had to borrow money in order to pay wages and to create a working medical service. The Habsburg Army consisted of German, Austrian, and Hungarian infantry and cavalry forces . Thanks to Palatine Paul Eszterh\u00e1zy, the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary contributed to Ottoman-Habsburg wars with 20,000 soldiers. Serb light cavalry and Serbian Militia conscripts also took part in the coalition. When news arrived that the Sultan and his army were in Belgrade, Eugene decided to concentrate all his available troops from Upper Hungary and Transylvania and started to move his troops towards Petrovaradin. After the concentration took place, Eugene had an Imperial army of 50,000 to 55,000 men to face the Ottomans. On 18 July, in the village of Kolut, Eugene held a military review of his forces. Soon he left with forces to Petrovaradin via Sombor. During August, Eugene offered battle in the neighborhood of the fortress of Petrovaradin but the Ottomans, attempting to start a siege, refused to engage in battle. In September the Ottomans moved north in an attempt to capture the fortress of Szeged and the Imperial army followed. There were few Kuruc cavalries in the Ottoman army under Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, however most of them fought alongside the Austrians.

Favre entered the stadium to a series of boos coming from Green Bay fans throughout the stadium. Minnesota started off the first quarter with Favre completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. The Packers responded with quarterback Aaron Rodgers completing a 62-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jermichael Finley. In the second quarter, the Vikings struck again with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Favre to wide receiver Sidney Rice, but Green Bay answered with linebacker Clay Matthews stripping running back Adrian Peterson of the ball and returning it 42 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings closed out the half with a 1-yard touchdown run from Peterson. Minnesota began to build a lead in the third quarter as Favre hooked up with wide receiver Bernard Berrian on a 31-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings solidified their lead as defensive end Jared Allen sacked Rodgers in the Green Bay endzone for a safety. The Packers rallied with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to wide receiver Jordy Nelson (with a failed 2-point conversion), followed by kicker Mason Crosby nailing a 31-yard field goal. However, the Packers' push came too late and Minnesota was able to run out the clock for the win. With the victory, not only did the Vikings improve to 4-0, but Favre became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat all 32 NFL teams.

Iraqi commandos used amphibious craft to block the Iranian rear, then used hundreds of tanks with massed conventional and chemical artillery barrages to recapture the island after 8 hours of combat. Saddam appeared live on Iraqi television to \"lead\" the charge against the Iranians. The majority of the Iranian defenders were killed during the quick assault. The final two Tawakal ala Allah operations took place near al-Amarah and Khaneqan. By 12 July, the Iraqis had captured the city of Dehloran,  inside Iran, along with 2,500 troops and much armour and material, which took four days to transport to Iraq. These losses included more than 570 of the 1,000 remaining Iranian tanks, over 430 armored vehicles, 45 self-propelled artillery, 300 towed artillery pieces, and 320 antiaircraft guns. These figures only included what Iraq could actually put to use; total amount of captured materiel was higher.

Looking to give themselves the tiebreaker with the Chiefs and stay above .500 on the season, the Raiders failed miserably. The defense allowed a field goal on the Chiefs' first possession to fall behind 3-0. The Chiefs extended the lead on the first play of the second quarter as Kareem Hunt scored from one yard out. Trailing 10-0, the Raider offense was only able to get one first down on their first three possessions. The Chiefs, scoring on their third straight possession, got another field goal to move their lead to 13-0. The Raiders began to move the ball on their ensuing possession, moving into Chiefs territory. However, Derek Carr was intercepted at the Chief 24 to end the drive. The Chiefs added another field goal on the ensuing possession, moving the lead to 16-0 with 1:45 remaining in the half. The Raiders quickly went three and out, giving the Chiefs, who had scored on their first four possessions, the ball with 1:14 remaining. The defense was able to keep the Chiefs from scoring as the half ended. The Chiefs began the second half with another field goal to take a 19-0 lead. A Raider three and out preceded the first punt of the game by the Chiefs. Looking to take advantage of the defense's first real stop of the game, Carr hit Johnny Holton on a 19-yard pass on the first play of the drive, but Holton fumbled and the Chiefs recovered. The Chiefs immediately turned the ball back over as Alex Smith was intercepted on the first play of the ensuing drive. However, the Raiders failed to convert on the turnover and punted to the Chiefs again. Four plays later Charcandrick West scored on a 13-yard run to extend the Chief lead to 26-0 and all but ending the game. After the teams exchanged punts, the Raiders finally scored with just under nine minutes left in the fourth quarter as Marshawn Lynch rushed 22 yards for a touchdown. Following a successful two-point conversion, the Raiders recovered an onside kick and Carr hit Jared Cook on a 29-yard pass to narrow the lead to 26-15. Electing not to attempt another onside kick, the Chiefs took over and were able to run nearly five minutes off the clock before punting to the Raiders with 2:39 remaining. The Raiders were able to move the ball, but Carr was intercepted in the end zone with 46 seconds left and the Chiefs were able to run out the clock. The 26-15 loss moved the Raiders to 6-7 on the season. The Raiders again struggled as the defense gave up 408 yards while the offense managed only 268, most of which occurred after the game had been decided.

The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \"flex scheduling\" policy.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \"finesse team\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \"LH\" decals on the backs of their helmets.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs. Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185&#160;yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception.  It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one.  Lawrence Tynes was the only scorer for the Chiefs, kicking three field goals from 45, 52 and 24&#160;yards out.

The Raiders struggled from the outset, allowing the Cowboys to drive inside Raider territory before Sean Smith intercepted a Dak Prescott pass to end the drive. Following a punt by the Raiders, the Cowboys moved right down the field, but were stopped at the Oakland 27 yard line. Settling for a 45-yard field goal, the Cowboys took the lead. The Raiders failed to manage a first down again on their second possession, the Cowboys took over and moved down field again. This time, the Raider defense could not stop the Cowboys and Rod Smith scored on a one-yard run to increase the Cowboy lead to 10-0. The Raider offense did manage two first downs on their next possession, but again were forced to punt. After forcing a Cowboy punt, the Raiders took over with just over three minutes left in the half. The offense came alive as the Raiders moved down to the Cowboy 11 yard line. Derek Carr then hit Jared Cook for an 11 yard touchdown, but Cook was called for pass interference on the play and the touchdown was taken off the board. The Raiders drive stalled and, with three seconds remaining, Giorgio Tavecchio missed a 39-yard field goal as the half expired leaving the score at 10-0. On the opening kickoff of the second half, Cordarrelle Patterson returned the kick 100 yards for a touchdown. However, the return was nullified on a Raider holding call. However, the Raider offense would make up for the mistake as they took the ball 90 yards and Carr found Michael Crabtree on a two-yard pass to narrow the lead to 10-7. On the ensuing Cowboy possession, Sean Smith intercepted Dak Prescott for the second time in the game and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown and Raider lead. Upon review of the play, it was determined that Smith was down by contact at the 22. The Raider offense failed to capitalize on the turnover, only managing one yard and settling for a Tavecchio 39-yard field goal to tie the game at 10. The Raider defense continued its strong play to start the second half by stopping the Cowboys on three plays on the next possession. However, punter Chris Jones took the snap and rushed around the right side of the line for a 24-yard gain and a first down. Nine plays later, Prescott scrambled in from five yards out to retake the lead 17-10. As the fourth quarter began, the Raiders answered as Carr again hit Crabtree from two yards out to cap a 53-yard drive to tie the game at 17. Following punts by both teams, the Cowboys moved to the Raider five-yard line as the two minute warning sounded. However, the Raider defense stiffened and the Cowboys could not get the ball in the end zone. Dan Bailey hit a 19-yard field goal with 1:47 remaining to give the Cowboys a 20-17 lead. Needing a field goal to tie, the Raiders drive stalled at their own 30 yard line with just over one minute remaining. On fourth down, Carr rolled out of the pocket and heaved the ball downfield to Crabtree who could not make the catch. But, the Cowboys were called for pass interference on the play and the Raiders took over on the Dallas 15, well within field goal range. Two plays later, Carr scrambled to the goal line and would have had a first down, but instead attempted to dive to the pylon to score the winning touchdown. Carr, however, lost control of the ball attempting to reach it into the end zone and fumbled it out of the end zone giving the ball to the Cowboys on a touchback. The Cowboys were able to a knee to end the game and secure the 20-17 win. The loss moved the Raiders to 6-8 on the season and eliminated them from the AFC West race.

Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf , the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf , and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.

Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This was a humiliation for the Tsar, in part because he requested the truce. Under the agreement Russia would surrender all areas in Livonia it still held and the city of Dorpat to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while Polotsk would remain under Commonwealth control. Any captured Swedish territory\u2014specifically Narva\u2014could be retained by the Russians and Velike Luki would be returned from Batory's control to Russia. Possevino made a half-hearted attempt to get John III's wishes taken into consideration, but this was vetoed by the Tsar, probably in collusion with Batory. The armistice, which fell short of a full peace arrangement, was to last ten years and was renewed twice, in 1591 and 1601. Batory failed in his attempts to pressure Sweden into relinquishing its gains in Livonia, particularly Narva. Following a decision by John, the war with Russia ended when the Tsar concluded the Truce of Plussa  with Sweden on 10 August 1583. Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod.

Britain also dispatched 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt. Ferdinand had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758 before crossing the Rhine with his own forces,  which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of D\u00fcsseldorf, he was compelled by the successful manoeuvering of larger French forces to withdraw across the Rhine. By this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf , a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758, fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count William Fermor.

It was described in 1649, probably with the remnants of the moat, and was depicted in 1749 as a large, apparently L-shaped building with a central cupola. It appears to have been rebuilt in the third quarter of the 18th century and by the time of Lady (Sarah) Salusbury was a three-storeyed villa with a central canted entrance bay rising the full height of the north front. A lower wing, presumably an addition, ran southward from the east end. In 1789 Humphry Repton landscaped roughly  of demesne grounds and William Wilkins supplied drawings for a Gothic seat. In his Red Book Repton commented favourably on the hilltop site and enhanced the view towards London. The house and 23 acres, increased by 1834 to 53 acres, was occupied by Trotter baronets (1804-36), Lady Trotter (1836-40), Lady (Elizabeth) Salusbury (1840-3), and Charles Hambro (1843-9). The house was extended westward and a semicircular bay was added to the south front in the early 19th century. By 1849 the demesne fell to 27 acres and the house, described in 1816 as being commodious yet having no regularity of architectural character and in 1822 as an elegant seat, three-storeyed. It continued as a gentlemans residence under Mrs. Howard (1850-3), Henry Vallence (1853-6), Mrs. Geach (1856-61), John Coverdale (1862-7), and Thomas Brandon (1867-76), and in 1877 was offered for sale with 52 acres. After remaining empty it was leased as a school, to Margaret Clark (1882-98) and Lucy Soulsby (1898-1915). In 1891 the school added a classroom and dormitory block on the east and later a chapel beyond that. The house continued as a school until 1934 when, described as shabby-looking, it was bought by C.

In 1994 Johnson joined with former pros Mark Aguirre, Reggie Theus, John Long (basketball), Earl Cureton, Jim Farmer, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan. They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the Continental Basketball Association. In the final game of the CBA series, Magic Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126-121 victory over the Oklahoma City Cavalry. By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55-0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game. Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November, 2001. Magic, at the age of 42, played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State Spartans mens basketball. Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, this was Johnsons first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years. Playing in front of a sold out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points. Johnsons half court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short. On November 1, 2002 Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State.

In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Packers sliced away in the second quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant getting a 6-yard TD run, while CB Will Blackmon returned a punt 57&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Raiders would end the half with their only score of the game as QB Josh McCown completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter. In the third quarter, Green Bay took control with rookie Mason Crosby nailing a 44-yard field goal, QB Brett Favre completing an 80-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings, while Blackmon recovered an Oakland fumble in their endzone for a touchdown (making him the first player since Cincinnati's Lemar Parrish in 1974 to return a punt and a fumble for a touchdown in one game). In the fourth quarter, the Packers pulled away with Favre completing a 46-yard TD pass to TE Donald Lee.

The boundary drawn up between the two nations was the Uruguay River, with Portugal possessing the land east of the river. The seven Jesuit missions east of the Uruguay River, known as the Misiones Orientales, were to be dismantled and relocated on the Spanish western side of the river. The seven missions were called San Miguel, Santos Angeles, San Lorenzo Martir, San Nicolas, San Juan Bautista, San Luis Gonzaga, and San Francisco de Borja. These missions were some of the most populous in South America with 26,362 inhabitants, according to a Jesuit census, and many more in the surrounding areas. In 1754 the Jesuits surrendered control of the missions, but the Guarani led by Sep\u00e9 Tiaraju, refused to comply with the order to relocate. Efforts by the Spanish army in 1754 to forcefully remove the Guarani from the missions failed. On February 10, 1756, a combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers fought the Guaran\u00ed at the battle of Caiboat\u00e9. It resulted in the death of 1,511 Guarani, while the Europeans suffered only 4 deaths. In the aftermath of the battle, the joint Spanish-Portuguese army occupied the seven missions.

Navajo warriors killed a servant of the commanding officer in retaliation for the killing of their people's livestock without compensation.

Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumi\u00f1ahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.:221-223,226 Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536. Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled.

Liubartas' brothers Algirdas and K\u0119stutis organized several expeditions to Poland and Red Ruthenia. Lithuanians allied themselves with Muscovy: Liubartas married an unnamed daughter of Konstantin of Rostov, a relative of Simeon of Moscow, and Algirdas married Uliana of Tver, sister-in-law of Simeon. In spring 1351, Lubartas was taken prisoner by Louis, but was released in summer after a truce was agreed upon with K\u0119stutis. The deal fell through and more military attacks followed in 1352. Another truce, rather favorable to the Lithuanians, was signed in fall 1352: Lubartas received not only Volhynia and Podolia, but also Belz and Che\u0142m. However, already in 1353, Liubartas attacked again. Casimir responded by organizing a large campaign against the pagan Lithuanians with a special permission from Pope Innocent VI. After the campaign did not achieve the desired results, Casimir contemplated an alliance with the Lithuanians. In 1366, Casimir, allied with Siemowit III of Masovia and nephews of Liubartas, resumed the war. As Algirdas was involved in conflicts in the east and K\u0119stutis fought with the Teutonic Knights, Liubartas had to defend alone and was defeated. In fall 1366, a treaty was signed: Liubartas retained only eastern Volhynia with Lutsk and became somewhat dependent on Poland . Casimir awarded his allies: Yuri, son of Karijotas, received Che\u0142m, his brother Alexander received Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and Yuri, son of Narimantas, continued to rule Belz.", "qa_pairs":

The smaller army, led by Maha Sithu, continued to pursue Ming Rui while the larger army led by Maha Thiha Thura advanced through the mountainous route to emerge directly behind the Chinese. Through careful maneuvering, the Burmese managed to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese at modern-day Pyinoolwin , about 50 miles northeast of Ava. Over the course of three days of bloody fighting, the Bannerman army was completely annihilated. The slaughter was such that the Burmese could hardly grip their swords as the hilts were slippery with enemy blood. Of the original 30,000 men of the main army, only 2500 remained alive and were captured. The rest had been killed either on the battlefield, through disease or through execution after their surrender. Ming Rui himself was severely wounded in battle.

The Giants responded, with running back Brandon Jacobs rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to pull the Giants to within 17-16 with three minutes remaining in the third quarter. However, the Broncos would seize control of the game with 21 unanswered points, beginning with a 25-yard touchdown run by Moreno, followed in the fourth quarter by an 11-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to tight end Julius Thomas, and return specialist Trindon Holliday returning a punt 81 yards for a touchdown. The Giants tried to rally, with quarterback Eli Manning throwing a 23-yard touchdown pass to running back Da'Rel Scott with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but a 47-yard field goal by Prater put the game out of reach.

Duchy of Lithuania, after Vytautas the Great died in 1430 without leaving an heir.  The war was fought on the one side by \u0160vitrigaila, allied with the Teutonic Knights, and on the other by Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis, backed by the Kingdom of Poland. The war threatened to sever the Union of Krewo, the personal union between Poland and Lithuania. \u0160vitrigaila's alliance with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Paul von Rusdorf, launched the Polish-Teutonic War  but failed to secure victory for \u0160vitrigaila. When Sigismund captured power in Lithuania by staging a coup in 1432, Lithuania split into two opposing camps, and there began three years of devastating hostilities. To prevent the Knights from continuing their support of \u0160vitrigaila, Poland backed a Hussite invasion of Prussia in 1433. The war ended in a decisive defeat for \u0160vitrigaila and his ally, the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights, at the Battle of Pabaiskas in September 1435. \u0160vitrigaila eventually surrendered in 1437; Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis ruled Lithuania for only eight years before he was assassinated in 1440.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many years did the Lithuanian Civil War last?", "answer":

On a broken play, Manziel found Benjamin and threw a touchdown to put the Browns up 28-14.  The Titans reached the red zone on their next drive, but Mariota fumbled and lost the ball, allowing the Browns to run out the clock.  After committing 5 turnovers in their season opener, the Browns had 0 turnovers while forcing 3 Titans turnovers.  For Cleveland, Armonty Bryant led the Browns with 2.5 sacks (of the 7 total) as they pressured the Titans to turn over the ball 3 times, and a selection for AFC Special Teams Player of the Week was bestowed upon WR/KR Travis Benjamin, who had 269 all-purpose yards, including a 78-yard punt return TD. With the win, the Browns ended their six-game losing streak and improved to 1-1 on the season.

against the Pittsburgh Steelers, who entered the game under the direction of the team's new head coach, Mike Tomlin. However, the Browns' ended the day with a 34-7 loss to the Steelers. A number of Browns errors gave Pittsburgh opportunities to take a first quarter lead. After being stopped on their first possession, the Browns were forced to punt. Paul Ernster fumbled the snap, which resulted in a poor kick, and the Browns were called for four penalties on the play. The Steelers took possession on the Browns' 22-yard line and scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Ben Ben Roethlisberger to Hines Ward. On the Browns' next possession, Charlie Frye threw an interception to Deshea Townsend, which eventually led to the Steelers' second score of the game, a 26-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. The Brown next possession ended when Jamal Lewis fumbled the ball at the Browns' 40-yard line. The Steelers quickly converted the turnover, with Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes on the next play to bring the score to 17-0. After being sacked five times and throwing for only 34&#160;yards on 4-of-10 passing, Frye was removed from the game and was replaced by second-string quarterback Derek Anderson. In the second quarter, Willie Parker fumbled the ball and gave the Browns possession. However, the team was forced to punt, and just two drives later, the Browns fumbled the ball again - this time on a sack by Ryan Clark of Anderson. The Browns were able to hold the Steelers scoreless through the second quarter as Roethlisberger failed to connect on his last six pass attempts of the quarter. However, the Steelers also held the Browns scoreless, and the teams entered halftime with the Steelers ahead 17-0. The second half began well for the Steelers, with an eight-play, 71-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie Matt Spaeth. The Browns countered with a long drive of 76&#160;yards that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to second-year fullback Lawrence Vickers, cutting the deficit to 24-7. However, this would be the Browns' only score of the game. On the next drive, the Steelers answered with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Heath Miller, giving the Steelers a 31-7 advantage. The Browns punted on their next possession, and the Steelers capped an eight-minute drive with a 31-yard field goal by Reed, giving the Steelers a 34-7 lead, which they never surrendered. On the Browns' next offensive possession, Braylon Edwards dropped a pass from Anderson, which was ruled a fumble. Following a Steelers punt, Anderson threw an interception to Ike Taylor on a pass intended for Edwards, and Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch ran the clock out, securing the win. The loss put the Browns record at 0-1, and allowed the Steelers to take a one-game lead in the overall series, 56 wins to 55. Following the game, head coach Romeo Crennel stated that he didn't know who would start at quarterback in the next game versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He also stood by his decision not to insert rookie Brady Quinn into the game, even after chants were heard from the home crowd hoping otherwise. On Tuesday, September 11, the Browns traded Frye, who was expected to start against the Bengals in week two, to the Seattle Seahawks for a sixth-round draft choice. The Browns are the first team since 1970 to trade their starting quarterback before Week 2. The team's general manager, Phil Savage, stated that Anderson was to be named the team's new starting quarterback, with Quinn moving up the depth chart to be Anderson's backup. The Browns also re-signed Ken Dorsey, whom the team had cut just ten days earlier, to be the team's third-string quarterback and mentor to Quinn.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many points did the

Of these, no more than 4,000 struck gold and only a few hundred became rich. By the time most of the stampeders arrived in 1898, the best creeks had all been claimed, either by the long-term miners in the region, or by the first arrivals of the year before. The Bonanza, Eldorado, Hunker and Dominion Creeks were all taken, with almost 10,000 claims recorded by the authorities by July 1898; a new prospector would have to look further afield to find a claim of his own. Geologically, the region was permeated with veins of gold, forced to the surface by volcanic action and then worn away by the action of rivers and streams, leaving nuggets and gold dust in deposits known as placer gold. Some ores lay along the creek beds in lines of soil, typically 15 feet  to 30 feet  beneath the surface. Others, formed by even older streams, lay along the hilltops; these deposits were called \"bench gold\". Finding the gold was challenging.

On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory.  Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR Javon Walker to make the score 14-0. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB Ben Roethlisberger completed a 35-yard pass to WR Cedrick Wilson, who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered. In the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10-0 on the quarter.  Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker for his first touchdown pass of the game.  The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB Champ Bailey.  After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker.  On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker. Denver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker.  This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line.  Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR Hines Ward leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a John Lynch (American football) tackle, whereby the Broncos safety Curome Cox recovered the fumble.

Alexopoulos estimate, however, is supported by indirect and misinterpreted evidences, and has obvious methodological difficulties.

During the two games played between the rivals last season, the Bears won the first game 28-10, while the Vikings won the second 21-14. Since 2001, the Bears led the series 16-10. ESPN writes that the Bears could capitalize on the Vikings' tendency to turn the ball over, as they gave away the ball to the Detroit Lions four times in week one. Chicago's defense should also prevent NFL MVP Adrian Peterson, who had been struggling when playing the Bears at Soldier Field. Since 2009, Peterson has been able to record only 73 rushing yards per game. The Bears fell behind early after Cordarrelle Patterson's 105-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Devin Hester attempted to respond on the ensuing kickoff, but was pushed out of bounds at the Vikings' 32-yard line. The Bears fought back with a one-yard touchdown pass by Jay Cutler to Martellus Bennett, which Chicago added to with Cutler's touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. In the second quarter, Jared Allen stripped the ball from Cutler, and Brian Robison returned the fumble 61 yards for a touchdown with 7:34 to go in the half. Afterwards, Hester returned the kickoff 80 yards to Minnesota's 23-yard line. The Bears offense later reached Minnesota's one-yard line, but Cutler had his pass intercepted by Kevin Williams in the end zone for a touchback. The Vikings failed to capitalize on the turnover after Tim Jennings intercepted Christian Ponder and scored on a 44-yard interception return. Minnesota retaliated with Ponder's 20-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph with 1:11 remaining, and the half ended with the Bears settling for a field goal. In the second half, the Vikings scored two field goals from Blair Walsh to take the 30-24 lead. However, the Bears scored on Cutler's 16-yard touchdown pass to Bennett, and ultimately prevailed after recovering a fumbled squib kick. The win marked the second time in franchise history that the Bears won their first two games after trailing in the fourth quarter, the first being in 1971. During halftime, the team honored the 1963 Bears, two days following the death of running back Rick Casares, who was the team's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him. When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, \"Oh my God, I think when you talk to my fellow teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares.

After a Dolphins punt, the Pats drove 42 yards to the Dolphins 38, but Brady was intercepted by Jason Trusnik at the 34. The Dolphins drove 60 yards to the Patriots 6, but the red zone defense forced them to kick a 24-yard field goal. After a Patriots punt, the Dolphins drove to their own 45, but Ryan Tannehill was intercepted by Duron Harmon at the Patriots 34 and returned the ball 60 yards to the Dolphins 8. Three plays later, Shane Vereen ran in a 3-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-3. Jarvis Landry returned the ensuing kick 26 yards to the Dolphins 37.

After another Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots need just three plays to put the game on ice. First Jonas Gray ran for 6 yards to the Dolphins 41, followed by Brady hooking up with Gronkowski for 35 yards to the Patriots 6.

The Patriots offensive line was immensely better than the opening day game against Miami as Brady wasn't sacked at all. Brady tossed 2 TDs to Edelman and Gronkowski while Vereen and Blount picked up rushing TDs. Gronkowski was their leading receiver with 96 yards and 1 touchdown on just 3 catches, and in the process secured his second 1,000 yard season.

The defense got off to a fast start right away and dominated for 59 minutes, forcing 4 turnovers in the contest. QB Andrew Luck fumbled on the Colts' 1 yard line, and the ball was recovered in the endzone to make it 7-0.  With a chance to go up 10-0, Browns K Billy Cundiff missed a 40 yd. field goal that would later prove to be very costly.  Following the miss, Luck rushed for a TD to tie the game at 7-7.  On the next drive, Hoyer led the Browns downfield; Rookie RB Isaiah Crowell ran in for a touchdown to lead 14-7 at halftime. In the second half, the Colts' turnover problems continued, committing a fumble on their first drive that the Browns couldn't convert into points. Later in the quarter, Luck threw a \"pick-six\" to Browns rookie DB Justin Gilbert (his 1st INT of the year), and the Browns went up 21-7.  The next two Colts' drives resulted in points (a field goal and a T. Y. Hilton touchdown), cutting the deficit to 21-16 heading into the 4th quarter. Adding another FG in the 4th to make it 21-19, and with a chance to take the lead, Luck threw another interception (he was sacked 3 times). However, the Browns failed to get a first down and were forced to settle for 3, making it 24-19 Browns and leaving the door open for the Colts to take the lead. With less than 4 minutes to go, Luck led a 90-yard game-winning touchdown drive. The Browns had a chance to end the game with a stop on 4th and inches at the 3 yard line, but RB Dan Herron avoided the tackle and picked up 2 yards for a Colts first down. Luck would throw the game-winning TD pass to Hilton on the next play, making it 25-24 Colts with 36 seconds left. After a failed two point conversion, and with the Browns having one more chance to win the game, Hoyer threw his 2nd INT with less than 10 seconds remaining, and the Colts ran out the clock. The Browns' offense was barely noticeable throughout the contest. TE Jordan Cameron returned to duty after 5 weeks, leading all Browns receivers with only 41 yds. 17 of the teams' 24 points came off of Colts turnovers, the defense converting two into TD's.  Punt and kick coverage teams kept returning fan-favorite KR Joshua Cribbs in check, and traded RB Trent Richardson was held to 30 yds. on 7 carries. MLB D'Qwell Jackson had 9 tackles for Indy, but no sacks. In the second half, the Browns' offense failed to convert a single 3rd down (0/6).  For the fourth consecutive game, Hoyer was dismal, passing 14/31 for 140 yards, 0 TD's, and 2 INT's (the third straight game that Hoyer had 0 TD's and multiple INT's).  It was the second game in a row that the Browns failed to win after holding a halftime lead.  It was only the second time that the Browns lost when holding a 4th quarter lead at any point (the other loss coming to the Ravens in Week 3). After starting 6-3, the Browns are 1-3 in their last 4 games.  The Browns' offense scored 26 points in their one victory while all 3 losses featured the offense scoring 10 or fewer points. The Browns fell to 7-6 on the season; wins by the Steelers and Ravens would leave the Browns in sole possession of 4th place in the AFC North.

The Browns also lost their ninth consecutive December game, a drought that goes back to Week 15 of the 2012 season.

This meant neither Austria or the Empire signed the Treaty of Utrecht of 11 April 1713 between France and the other Allies; Spain made peace with the Dutch in June, then Savoy and Britain on 13 July 1713.

The Treaty of Rastatt on 7 March 1714 confirmed Austria's gains in Italy, returned Breisach, Kehl and Freiburg, ended French support for the Hungarian revolt and terms for the Dutch Barrier fortresses. France acquired Strasbourg and Alsace while Charles agreed to reinstate the Wittelsbach Electors of Bavaria and Cologne, Max Emmanuel and Joseph Clemens.

Pew also found that the Catholic population is aging, forming a higher percentage of the elderly population than the young, and retention rates are also worse among the young. About 41% of those \"young\" raised Catholic have left the faith (as opposed to 32% overall), about half of these to the unaffiliated population and the rest to evangelical, other Protestant faith communities, and non-Christian faith. Conversions to Catholicism are rare, with 89% of current Catholics being raised in the religion; 8% of current Catholics are ex-Protestants, 2% were raised unaffiliated, and 1% in other religions (Orthodox Christian, Mormon or other nontrinitarian, Buddhist, Muslim, etc.), with Jews and Hindus least likely to become Catholic of all the religious groups surveyed. Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. This is credited to the more liberal stance of the Church since Vatican II, where conversion to Catholicism is no longer encouraged, and the de-emphasizing of basic Catholic religious beliefs in Catholic education. Still, according to the 2015 Pew Research Center, \"the Catholic share of the population has been relatively stable over the long term, according to a variety of other surveys  By race, 59% of Catholics are non-Hispanic white, 34% Hispanic, 3% black, 3% Asian, and 2% mixed or Native American. Conversely, 19% of non-Hispanic whites are Catholic in 2014 (down from 22% in 2007), whereas 48% of Hispanics are (versus 58% in 2007). In 2015, Hispanics are 38%, while blacks and Asians are still at 3% each. Because conversion away from Catholicism is presently occurring much more quickly among Hispanics than among non-Hispanic whites, it is unclear whether they will outnumber non-Hispanic whites among Catholics or not in the foreseeable future.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Were there more or less Catholics in 2014 than there were in 2007?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["less"]}, "query_id": "79d5fe15-b894-4492-8d00-c51e41468c2f", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "Are more Catholics ex-protestants or previously unaffiliated?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["ex-protestants"]}, "query_id": "7efe9222-9856-48ff-bbca-229e98e8dda7", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "Which races make up less than 5% of the Catholic religion?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["black", "Asian", "mixed or Native American"]}, "query_id": "2537aedf-f1a7-4f35-afb8-1acb94d63651", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more million adult Catholics were there in 2007 compared to 2014?", "answer": {"number": "3.4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "40d6157f-476a-4daf-9fbb-e6aa07b385e2", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more, in percent,  of  \"young\" raised Catholic have left the faith compared to overall?", "answer": {"number": "9", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "519c7b69-1f28-47c6-a3b1-450ae162e161", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more Catholics, in percent, were Hispanic compared to a black?", "answer": {"number": "31", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "a2ef56f6-4fb9-410d-be48-62c4445dce07", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more Catholics, in percent, were non-hispanic white compared to a black?", "answer": {"number": "56", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "6e4f53ea-77df-4e3b-a24f-0d559d4a2756", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more Catholics, in percent, were non-Hispanic white compared to a black, Asian and mixed or Native American combined?", "answer": {"number": "51", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "4a54842f-b132-48c2-8611-da60b6403d6e", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more Catholics, in percent, were Hispanic compared to a black, Asian and mixed or Native American combined?", "answer": {"number": "26", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "4710dd2f-80f0-46b2-af5b-96a4a47227bd", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_1871": {"passage": "Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Giants the Texans played on home ground for an AFC duel against the Chiefs.

Romo ran a quarterback sneak to open the scoring in the second half, but the Giants sent wide receiver Steve Smith into the end zone in the fourth quarter.

Many folk songs were written from 1918 to 1922 that were inspired by people and events of this conflict. \"Oi u luzi chervona kalyna\" and \"Oi vydno selo\" were inspired by the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen unit of the Austro-Hungarian Army, which became the core battalion of the West Ukrainian People's Republic's Ukrainian Galician Army. \"Pisnya pro Tiutiunnyk\" was inspired by events surrounding Ukrainian People's Army brigade commander Yuriy Tiutiunnyk. Another song written at this time was \"Za Ukrayinu\". These \"war songs\" started to be sung publicly again in the western part of the Ukrainian SSR after the introduction of glasnost by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and regained popularity throughout Ukraine after independence - especially during the current Russian military intervention. Another musical legacy of this period was the Ukrainian Republic Capella , set up in early 1919 by the Directorate government of Symon Petliura. Under the direction of Oleksandr Koshetz, the Capella/Chorus toured Europe and North America from 1919 to 1921 and while in exile from 1922 to 1927; popularising the songs \"Shchedryk\" and \"Oi khodyt son, kolo vikon\" - which influenced the composition of the popular English language songs \"Carol of the Bells\" and \"Summertime\", respectively.

debut of Robert Griffin III, the second overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. Griffin started his career as well as possible, going 6/6 on his opening possession, setting up a 37-yard field goal by new Redskins kicker Billy Cundiff. However, the lead would be short lived as Six-time Pro Bowl QB Drew Brees marched his Saints down the field, culminating in a 20-yard touchdown pass to star tight end Jimmy Graham. For the first time, Griffin's resolve was tested, as he marched onto the field trailing for the first time. Griffin was unfazed, and after not completing a pass ahead of the line of scrimmage on his first possession, Griffin connected with fellow new Redskins Pierre Gar&#231;on for an 88-yard strike to give Washington a 10-7 lead. In the second quarter, Washington's lead continued to grow, as Griffin found second-year man Aldrick Robinson for a 5-yard touchdown pass to extend Washington's advantage to 17-7. Cundiff added a 41-yard field goal to give Washington a 20-7 advantage. On the next Saints ensuing possession, Brees found Marques Colston who was on his way to an apparent touchdown, but fumbled in the Washington endzone, which resulted in a touchback. Appearing to go into the second half up 20-7, Saverio Rocca's punt was blocked and returned four yards for a touchdown by Saints special teamer Courtney Roby to make it 20-14 at the half. Getting the ball to start the second half, Washington extended its advantage by way of a 1-yard rush TD by rookie running back Alfred Morris. Washington would again expand upon its lead via Cundiff's 37-yarder, to make it 30-14 Washington. Saints kicker Garrett Hartley hit a 21-yard field goal to close the third quarter scoring at 30-17. In the fourth, Washington again pushed its advantage to 16 when Billy Cundiff nailed his fourth field goal of the day, this one from 45 yards. However, the Saints would not go quietly. On the Saints' ensuing possession, Brian Orakpo dropped an interception on 3rd and 10 that would've all but sealed the deal. With this new break, Brees made the Redskins pay, as Lance Moore beat Madieu Williams to the endzone for a 33-yard touchdown on 4th-and-10. Darren Sproles scored on the two-point conversion to cut the Redskins lead to 33-25. The Redskins could not amass a first down on their next drive, and Drew Brees got the ball back with the crowd sensing a comeback. However, Brees overthrew his intended receiver on the first play of the drive, and DeJon Gomes returned the interception to the Saints 3-yard line, and on the next play, Alfred Morris extended the advantage to 40-25. However, the Saints continued to battle. It took Brees less than one minute to march New Orleans down the field and find Darren Sproles for a 2-yard touchdown pass, and the Saints again pulled within 8. The Redskins got the ball back and were able to nearly run out the clock, but gave Brees one last chance. However, fortunately for the Redskins, Brees' Hail Mary pass on the final play of the game fell short of the intended target and was intercepted by Reed Doughty to preserve the 40-32 upset win. With the win, the Redskins began the season 1-0. Robert Griffin III became the first rookie QB to throw for 300 yards in his debut game and win the game.

The game began with a coin toss in which the Pats won and elected to kick. After forcing the Jets to punt on the first drive of the game, the Patriots used good field position to reach the Jets' 11 and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the early lead with a 29-yard field goal. On 3rd-and-11 on the Jets next drive, Bryce Petty was intercepted by Malcolm Butler at the Jets' 47 for no gain. The Patriots wasted no time, needing just 8 plays to score on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Bennett, extending the lead to 10-0. After both teams punted on their next possession, Khiry Robinson lost a fumble while being tackled by Elandon Roberts and Butler recovered for the Patriots. Petty was suffered a dislocated shoulder injury on the play and wouldn't return, being replaced by embattled veteran, Ryan Fitzpatrick. Taking over at the Jets' 28, outstanding field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Jets 4, but could only settle for a field goal. The Jets finally moved the ball on their ensuing possession, but Nick Folk missed a 34-yard field goal wide right. Following a Patriots three-and-out, Fitzpatrick was intercepted by Eric Rowe at the Patriots' 46 for no gain. It took the Patriots a mere four plays to score on Brady's 18-yard touchdown pass to third-string tight end Matt Lengel, his first career catch, and the lead widened to 20-0. As the Jets anemic offense punted, a 47-yard pass interference penalty on Doug Middleton moved the ball from the Patriots' 28 to the Jets' 25 and on the next play, Brady threw a touchdown pass to James White with just 0:25 seconds left in the half to increase the margin to 27-0. The pass was just out of the reach of linebacker David Harris, who was covering him. After the first two drives of the second half ended in punts, the Patriots marched 63 yards in 13, lasting nearly 8 minutes to further their lead to 34-0 on a 1-yard touchdown run by Blount. On the 5th play of the Jets next drive, Fitzpatrick was intercepted by Butler, his second, who returned the ball 21 yards to the Jets 47, plus a face mask penalty moving the ball to the Jets' 22. With Garoppolo replacing Brady, the Patriots continued rolling 8 plays later with another 1-yard touchdown run by Blount early in the fourth quarter. With that touchdown (his 17th of the season) the lead increased to 41-0. On their next drive, the Jets finally ended the shutout attempt with Folk's 29-yard field goal. After a Patriots punt, the Jets once again drove into Patriots territory, but turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots proceeded to run out the clock to end the game. The Patriots improved to 13-2, and their defense shut down Fitzpatrick, who had had a career day against the Patriots just four weeks earlier. The Patriots forced four turnovers from the Jets, including three interceptions; one being made by Eric Rowe and another two which were made by Malcolm Butler, who also recovered a fumble. Furthermore, head coach Bill Belichick recorded his 200th regular season victory with the Patriots; he became the fifth coach in NFL history to accomplish this feat with a single franchise.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many is the differencein the yards of the field goal made by Gostkowski and the yards of the TD pass to Bennet?", "answer": {"number": "24", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "f54d2df9-6ff8-4ff6-9786-19ce42d1be5f"}, {"question": "How many is the differencein the yards of the field goal made by Gostkowski and the yards of the field goal missed by Folk?", "answer": {"number": "5", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "9ab19241-0402-4017-98c5-cb0dd1213fca"}, {"question": "How many points did the Patriots win by?", "answer": {"number": "38", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "61ae5a38-496b-4eb4-bc2e-242515c541f7"}, {"question": "How many touchdowns did Blount score?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "3d346f06-744b-4f15-a5f7-e9fa5b40ffbf"}, {"question": "How many points did the Patriots win by?", "answer": {"number": "38", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "f2913799-38ae-4d21-886f-5def365f72b8"}, {"question": "How many touchdowns did Tom Brady throw?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "44e94232-0944-4b97-8320-3d9d78c93afd"}, {"question": "Who scored the last touchdown of the first half?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["James White"]}, "query_id": "ab265960-e414-4440-9180-b0eadf40b63d"}, {"question": "How many points did the Patriots beat the Jets by?", "answer": {"number": "38", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "75d4e1ec-ce10-44d0-9b0b-e76501773730", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals were successful in the first half?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "14daad41-599a-4dab-8806-0b3a2472cae8", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many of the Patriots touchdowns were passes?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "0d1242e1-0068-4335-a156-d96c4db97f1e", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many touchdowns were scored in the first half?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "6b270a71-7228-4fe8-a40e-cde15a2d7fc0", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "Who scored the first touchdown of the 2nd half?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Blount"]}, "query_id": "3bb9e6cc-da96-4762-b62a-e8c0e0ab1f7f", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "Which team scored more points in the first half, Patriots or Jets?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Patriots"]}, "query_id": "9f0423be-f3e3-4c6b-a5e4-ddb73fb20bb5", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_2449": {"passage": "This game would determine who would be atop the AFC East.

Finally, the Siamese relied on a heavily fortified Ayutthaya city, strategically situated at the estuary of two rivers where high rising waters in the rainy season had kept it safe against enemies over the centuries. The Siamese had used their wealth to acquire several thousand muskets and artillery. Some of the cannon were thirty feet  long, and fired 100-lb.  balls.

The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \"Popish Plot\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne.

After Janikowski missed a 48-yard field goal and following another three-and-out for the Broncos, Murray scored his second touchdown of the game and increase the lead to 20-7. The Broncos added a field goal as the first half ended, putting them within 10 at 20-10. No team could muster any points in the third quarter, but a second field goal by Brandon McManus cut the lead to seven with 14:56 left in the game. The Raiders answered with a field goal and Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Siemian to give the Raiders the ball on the Denver 39-yard line. Murray's third one-yard touchdown of the game put the Raiders up comfortably at 30-13. Denver answered immediately on the second play of the ensuing drive when Kapri Bibbs took a screen pass 75 yards to cut the lead to ten. However, the Raider defense stepped up again and forced Siemian to throw an interception to Reggie Nelson with 23 seconds remaining to end the threat. The Raiders ran for 218 yards and held Denver to just 33 yards rushing. Carr threw for 184 yards and Murray rushed for 114 in addition to his three touchdown runs. The win put the Raiders at 7-2 on the season and in sole possession of first place in the AFC West as they headed to their bye week.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How long was the attempted field goal that Janikowski missed?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["48-yard"]}, "query_id": "9ee2fd16-3d8d-496a-9b89-c6b075044122"}, {"question": "How many rushing yards did Murray have?", "answer": {"number": "114", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "8318b54a-08e5-40f1-bde4-c0d50b2f5ec6"}, {"question": "How many field goals were made in the game?", "answer": {"number": "5", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "c29fadc6-1db1-4bee-a6fd-bd62cb51b9e4"}, {"question": "How many field goals were missed?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "a5b74e9c-b5b5-4996-9bb5-2656d84611b7"}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "history_548": {"passage": "About 3,000 Orthodox Christians in Finland belong to the Russian Orthodox Church .

It was made compulsory to purchase salt from the salt loft . \"Gabelle\" officers took charge of punishing the unlawful trading of salt. But these were salt pan areas where the salt was freely traded. Salt smuggling  spread rapidly, especially after the Marennes and La Rochelle revolts in 1542, and the repression by the salt riders is out of the population acceptance. In 1548, riots break out in Angoumois and Saintonge demanding the release of the smugglers . The de Pitauds revolt grew to 20,000 members, led by a lord and joined by priests. Castles were plundered and salt-tax collectors killed. The revolt spread to Bordeaux where 20 salt tax collectors were killed, including the lieutenant governor, on August 21, 1548. King Henry II blockaded Bordeaux and launched his repression. Bordeaux lost its privileges. It was disarmed, paid a fine, saw its parliament suspended, and 1,401 people were sentenced to death. The repression spread to the countryside where the leaders were hanged: neither priests nor gentlemen were spared.

The Packers received the opening kickoff and stormed 81 yards needing only 7 plays with James Starks running in a 3-yard touchdown. The drive was so efficient they didn't even face a third down. As a sign of things to come, the Falcons struck right back with a 4-yard Steven Jackson touchdown run to end a 72-yard drive. The Packers, as they did often, answered the Falcons with another touchdown of their own. Showing off their ability to kill the clock with long drives, the Packers used 13 plays and over 7 minutes to go 80 yards with Lacy running in his second touchdown of the game on the first play of the second quarter. After a Falcons three-and-out the Packers again worked the clock, driving 80 yards in just under six minutes, but the Falcons defense made a rare stand and Crosby kicked a field goal. Morgan Burnett intercepted Matt Ryan on their next possession and returned it 32 yards to the Falcons 15. Four plays later Rodgers threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Lacy. The Falcons offense continued to sputter as they punted. The Packers stayed hot with Rodgers hitting Nelson for a 10-yard touchdown with twenty-four seconds left in the half. The Falcons managed to reach field goal range with the big play being a Ryan 30-yard bomb to Julio Jones. However, Brad Jones blocked Matt Bryant's 53-yard field goal attempt, leaving the score 31-7 at halftime. The Falcons busted out in the third quarter. On the first play from scrimmage Ryan launched a pass to Jones for 79 yards the Packers 3-yard line. However, they lost two yards on their next three plays, but on fourth-and-goal from the 5-yard line Ryan threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Eric Weems, trimming the score to 31-14. After a Packers punt the Falcons reached the Packers 31, but were forced to settle for a 50-yard field goal. The Packers added a field goal on their next drive, the Falcons mimicked the Packers clock-killing strategy (possibly, ultimately to their detriment) taking six-and-a-half minutes off the clock as they traveled 72 yards with Ryan dropping a 22-yard touchdown pass into the hands of Jones who had the best game of his career. However, Rodgers and the Packers offense regrouped and stormed 74 yards in four plays with Rodgers hitting his number one guy Nelson for a 60-yard touchdown pass. The Falcons' Rashede Hageman blocked Crosby's PAT keeping the deficit two scores at 40-24. The shootout continued as the Falcons answered right back with Ryan lobbing a 1-yard touchdown pass to Roddy White, but the two-point conversion failed which would prove critical as the score remained 40-30. The Falcons onside kick attempt failed, but they didn't allow a first down, keeping them in the game as Crosby nailed a 53-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 43-30. Ryan continued to shred the Packers' defense, darting a 2-yard touchdown pass to Harry Douglas, making the score 43-37 and giving the Falcons a chance to pull off the improbable comeback.

Though these imperial powers had experienced relatively few major conflicts between them over the previous hundred years, an underlying rivalry, otherwise known as \"the Great Game\", had exacerbated the situation to such an extent that resolution was sought. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 brought shaky British-Russian relations to the forefront by solidifying boundaries that identified their respective control in Persia  and Afghanistan.

A desire to preserve the state, not destroy it, motivated the revolutionaries. The revolt began in July 1908. Major Ahmed Niyazi, fearing discovery of his political moves by an investigatory committee sent from the capital, decamped from Resen on 3 July with 200 followers demanding restoration of the constitution. The sultan's attempt to suppress this uprising failed due to the popularity of the movement among the troops themselves. Rebellion spread rapidly due to the ideology of Ottomanism. On 24 July, sultan Abdul Hamid II capitulated and announced restoration of the 1876 constitution.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What caused the meeting that led to the Young Turk rebellion?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["the Great Game"]}, "query_id": "b872402e-4b9b-4cdd-8b1a-086fbeea1075"}, {"question": "Who participated in the rebellion?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Members of the military tradition", "military officers"]}, "query_id": "93ff9931-9e22-4617-9b2c-b9f66152258b", "incorrect_options": ["bad"]}, {"question": "What caused the Young Turk rebellion?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907"]}, "query_id": "68e03551-8051-475d-957f-07ee361d022f"}, {"question": "How many days did the rebellion of 1908 last?", "answer": {"number": "21", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "904af382-a27b-4fc5-8295-a4517d6438cd"}, {"question": "Which event happened first, the meeting between Edward VII and Nicholas II, or the revolution?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["meeting between Edward VII and Nicholas II"]}, "query_id": "c6dc2ac3-5508-439f-af0a-7f1d2940614e"}, {"question": "How many days did it take the mutiny of army units to achieve restoration of the 1876 constitution?", "answer": {"number": "21", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "f8c545eb-e148-4aaa-8927-583b9c1b87e4"}, {"question": "Fear of the division of what region caused the Turkish militia to revolt?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Macedonia"]}, "query_id": "8e97e529-e6a8-431f-8644-ce4229050d00"}, {"question": "How many days did the rebellion last before sultan Abdul Hamid II capitualted?", "answer": {"number": "21", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "be75dbd3-e5d9-414f-b983-6f0a46024798"}, {"question": "What happened first: event that triggered the Revolution or sultan's attempt to suppress the uprising?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["event that triggered the Revolution"]}, "query_id": "28fe86ed-97eb-4990-8a01-d9fae772b8f2"}, {"question": "What happened second: event that triggered the Revolution or sultan's attempt to suppress the uprising?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["sultan's attempt to suppress the uprising"]}, "query_id": "1bdaf09d-8608-4d4f-a9c7-6204343e2aab"}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_804": {"passage": "Coming off their home win over the Ravens, the Chargers flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 13 AFC West rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs.

revolt in Norfolk, England during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land. It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was yeoman farmer Robert Kett who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on Mousehold Heath to the north-east of the city on 12 July. The rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July and took the city. But on 1 August the rebels were defeated by an army led by the Marquess of Northampton who had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Dussindale.

Under the Hohenstaufen kings, Conrad\u00a0III and Frederick Barbarossa, Franconia became the centre of power in the Empire. During the time when there was no emperor, the Interregnum , some territorial princes became ever more powerful. After the Interregnum, however, the rulers succeeded in re-establishing a stronger royal lordship in Franconia. Franconia soon played an important role again for the monarchy at the time of Rudolf of Habsburg; the itineraries of his successors showing their preference for the Rhine-Main region.

With the loss, Washington fell to 3-5, and 0-2 against the AFC. Washington has now lost 6 straight games to AFC opponents and has not beaten an AFC team since Week 16 of the 2010 season.

along the French-German border to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement. By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia. On 4 February, Soviet, British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan. In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B, while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany. Several changes in leadership occurred during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.

The Broncos tried to add to their lead on their next possession, however, placekicker Brandon McManus missed on a 53-yard field goal attempt. The Chargers attempted a rally, but Rivers was intercepted by Broncos' safety Rahim Moore near the goal line with five minutes remaining in the game. The Broncos' offense then ran out most of the clock, aided by a crucial 5-yard pass completion from Manning to wide receiver Wes Welker on 3rd-and-4 from their own 10-yard line that forced the Chargers to burn the last two of their three team timeouts, sealing the win for the Broncos.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Which team had a four yard touchdown pass?", "answer": {"number": "", "date":

In the second quarter, Bailey made another field goal from 44 yards to put the Cowboys up by 3, but the Vikings took a 10-6 lead into halftime, capping the ensuing 79-yard drive with a 6-yard run by Ponder.

On the very next play from scrimmage, Ponder fumbled the ball as he was sacked in the end zone, and the Cowboys' Nick Hayden recovered it for a touchdown, meaning the Vikings went from 10-6 up to 20-10 down in the space of two scrimmage plays. The Vikings responded immediately with a quick, six-play drive, culminating with a 31-yard pass from Ponder to Kyle Rudolph to cut the Cowboys' lead back to three points. After a series of punts going into the fourth quarter, Adrian Peterson scored for the Vikings with an 11-yard run with almost six minutes to go, but Walsh pushed the extra point kick wide right, giving the Vikings a three-point lead over the Cowboys. Vikings cornerback A. J. Jefferson intercepted Romo on the Cowboys' ensuing drive, putting the Vikings in a position to potentially take over the game, but the offense went three-and-out and was forced to punt. The Cowboys progressed downfield quickly, never faced with a third down, and scored with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Dwayne Harris, the third time the Vikings had given up a game-winning score in 2013.

home stand was against the Browns.  Landry Jones started the game but left due to injury and was replaced by Ben Roethlisberger.  In the first quarter, the Steelers grabbed an early lead as Chris Boswell nailed a 24-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  The Browns tied it up however at 3-3 when Travis Coons kicked a 23-yard field goal.  The Steelers would retake the lead later on in the quarter when Boswell nailed a 34-yard field goal for a 6-3 game.  In the second quarter, it was all Steelers when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 4-yard pass (with a successful 2-point conversion) for a 14-3 lead followed up by Roethlisberger finding Martavis Bryant on a 32-yard pass for a 21-3 lead at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Steelers went back to work as Boswell kicked a 25-yard field goal for a 24-3 game for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Johnny Manziel found Gary Barnidge on a 7-yard pass (with a failed PAT) for a 24-9 game.  The Steelers later on would wrap the game up when Roethlisberger and Brown hooked up again this time on a 56-yard pass (with a failed PAT) for the final score of 30-9.

They torched the plantation house, then went to other plantations to mobilize other enslaved Africans to join the rebellion. Cuffy, an enslaved man at Lilienburg, another plantation on Canje, is said to have organized them into a military unit. As plantation after plantation fell to the slaves, the Dutch settlers fled northward and the rebels began to take over control of the region. For almost a year, the rebels held on to southern Berbice, while the whites were able to hold on to the north. Eventually only about half of the white population that had lived in the colony remained. The rebels came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas.

This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during Emperor Joseph IIs dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstels new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes. Today, Viennas University Library is the largest collection of books in Austria, still facing problems of space. In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries.", "qa_pairs":

documented presence in Cyprus since 578 AD: according to historian Theophylact Simocatta, during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I, Byzantine General Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners in Arzanene, of whom about 3,350 were deported to Cyprus. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. Between 1136-1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus. After Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against Richard the
