The Lions' opening possession ended at the Green Bay 12 when Clay Matthews forced a Reggie Bush fumble that was recovered by Morgan Burnett. However, the Packers could not capitalize, and the Lions drew first blood with a 27-yard field goal. Following a kickoff that went out-of-bounds, the Packers answered with a 54-yard field goal to tie it at 3-3. The Packers quickly struck again when Nick Perry forced a Matthew Stafford fumble that was returned by Morgan Burnett for a TD for a 10-3 lead. The Lions answered by scoring two TDs, first a 5-yard TD pass to Jeremy Ross, then a 1-yard run by Reggie Bush. Detroit had opportunities for more points before the half, but David Akers missed a 31-yard field goal as the 1st half expired, keeping a 17-10 lead.

duel with the Indianapolis Colts. Houston received the ball first, but punted the ball on 4th and 5 from their 25. After receiving the ball, the Colts ended their drive with a 27-yard field goal to lead 3-0 with 11:17 left in the 1st. In a surprise move, the Colts did an onside kick and recovered the ball on their 46. Luck threw a 54-yard pass for a touchdown, but the call was reversed as the runner was down. Luck threw another pass, this time for 49 yards, to get up to the Houston 5. Richardson rushed for a touchdown to give the Colts a 10-0 lead over the Texans. On their next 2 possessions, Houston was forced into a 3 and out, with Indianapolis scoring on their next possessions. Following a difficult 1st quarter, the Texans trailed 0-24. The 2nd quarter seemed to hold more good fortunes for the Texans, as they got a 1st down following a penalty against the Colts on what would have been a field goal attempt. Houston finally scored with a touchdown to trail 7-24 with 9:48 left in the 2nd. Momentum for the Texans continued as Luck's pass was intercepted by Tuggle at the Indianapolis 34, taking it to the 26. Houston wasted no time before capitalizing on the turnover to score a touchdown with 8:28 left to trail 14-24. The Colts ate up the clock on their next possession, before kick a 34-yard field goal with 1:09 left to lead 27-14. Things seemed to turn against Houston again on their next possession as Fitzpatrick was sacked and they failed to complete 1st down conversion on 4th and 9 with 0:03 left in the 2nd. At halftime, the Texans were trailing 14-27. The 3rd quarter started out quietly for both teams before Houston scored a touchdown with 6:03 left, to trail 21-27. The Colts scored on their next possession and failed on a two-point conversion to lead 33-21. With Houston trying to get ahead, they ended the 3rd quarter at the Indianapolis 24, trailing 21-33. With 14:23 left to play, Bullock missed a 37-yard field goal that went wide right. After a Colts fumble, Watt returned it for 45 yards for a touchdown. Watt's fumble return helped keep hopes of a comeback alive for the Texans, as they now trailed 28-33. The Houston defense held off the Indianapolis offense, who were forced to punt the ball back. The Texans could not manage a comeback as they fumbled the ball on each of their next 2 possessions. The Texans fell to the Colts, 28-33, dropped to 2nd place in the AFC South and dropped to 3-3. The 24 point deficit at the end of the 1st quarter is one of the largest in Texans history.

On 8 July 1415, the society was changed into the League of Constance, an alliance for mutual defense against Louis VII.  In 1417 in Constance, Louis insulted Henry by calling him \"the son of a cook\". When Louis then accused Henry of having shed human blood, Henry and fifteen of his followers physically attacked Louis and injured him severely. After this attack, Louis described Henry as a pluethunt , which did little to defuse the conflict. Henry XVI evaded punishment for the attack on Louis VII only through the intercession of Frederick of Brandenburg and his cousins Dukes Ernest and William III in Munich and especially by paying 6000 guilders to King Sigismund.  Henry XVI wanted revenge. The conflict escalated into a war when an army from Bavaria-Ingolstadt burned down the castle of the Burgrave of Nuremberg.

"nfl_3082": {"passage": "In Week 6, the Redskins played on the road for the second consecutive Sunday, this time against the 4-1 New York Jets, who had held three of their first four opponents to 14 points or less and were coming off of their bye week. Washington punted after going three-and-out on their first possession of the game. They were quickly back on offense, however, as Jets receiver Eric Decker was stripped by Bashaud Breeland at the Jets' 37-yard-line. After driving down to the 2-yard-line, Washington scored on a Kirk Cousins touchdown pass to Pierre Gar&#231;on, thanks to an uncharacteristic coverage error by former All-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis. New York's first four plays on the next drive all involved running back Chris Ivory, and gained 33 yards. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick then threw a 35-yard pass to Eric Decker, and Ivory punched it in for the tying score two plays later. The Jets' stingy defense held the Redskins in check on their next drive, forcing another punt to end the first quarter. Chris Ivory then energized the raucous New York crowd with a 54-yard run to just outside the Redskins' 20, but the drive stalled and placekicker Nick Folk tacked on three more points, giving New York a 10-7 lead. Three punts followed, two by Washington and one by New York, before Breeland forced and recovered his second fumble of the game, this one off of 5-time Pro Bowler and former All-Pro receiver Brandon Marshall. With a short field, Cousins and the Redskins gained 19 yards, and Redskins kicker Dustin Hopkins booted a career-long 54-yard field goal to tie the game at 10-10 with just over two minutes remaining in the first half. Fitzpatrick led the Jets into Redskins territory with three short passes that gained 32 yards, before being intercepted by Breeland at the Washington 20-yard-line, Breeland's third turnover recovery of the half. Six plays and three timeouts later, Hopkins converted a 30-yard field goal to give the visiting Redskins a 13-10 halftime lead. On the first New York drive of the second half, back-to-back plays by Ivory carried the Jets across midfield, and the game was quickly tied again thanks to a Nick Folk field goal. After a Jets punt and an Alfred Morris 2-yard run, Cousins was intercepted by Revis, who returned the ball to the Redskins' 18-yard line. Fitzpatrick, not normally known as a particularly mobile quarterback, saw a hole in the defense and scored an 18-yard rushing touchdown on the very next play. Washington had gone from a 3-point lead to a 7-point deficit in a span of only five plays, and now trailed 20-13. The turnover also kept alive Cousins' streak of having thrown an interception in every road game of his career. The next Redskins drive, a three-and-out, did nothing to help them regain the momentum, nor did the 14-yard Marshall catch, 18-yard Zac Stacy run, or 35-yard touchdown reception, also by Marshall, on the next Jets drive. Badly hoping to get themselves back in the game, the Redskins called a deep pass to former Duke University receiver Jamison Crowder, but Jets safety Marcus Gilchrist intercepted the ball for Cousins' second turnover of the game. New York continued to pile up big plays, as well, with a 32-yard Ivory run to start the drive, and two third-down conversions totaling 28 yards. Fitzpatrick capitalized on those conversions, and threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker, wrapping up a 21-0 third quarter that resulted in a 34-13 Jets lead. Still reeling with 11 minutes left, Washington desperately tried to mount a comeback, engineering a 59-yard drive that resulted in no points, due to an incomplete pass on 4th-and-1 from the Jets 2-yard-line. They ended up scoring later in the fourth quarter, but not on offense; undrafted rookie Rashad Ross blocked a Jets punt and recovered it in the endzone, which provided the game's final score of 34-20. The hometown New York Jets improved to a surprising 5-1, already surpassing their win total from the entire 2014 season. The Washington Redskins dropped to 2-4 on the season with the loss, and 0-3 on the road. In each of their four losses, Cousins had thrown 2 interceptions; he had thrown none in the two victories.

The current law excludes women from the succession. A change to this law had been considered until Princess Kiko gave birth to a son. Until the birth of Prince Hisahito, son of Prince Akishino, on September 6, 2006, there was a potential succession problem, since Prince Akishino was the only male child to be born into the imperial family since 1965. Following the birth of Princess Aiko, there was public debate about amending the current Imperial Household Law to allow women to succeed to the throne. In January 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed a special panel composed of judges, university professors, and civil servants to study changes to the Imperial Household Law and to make recommendations to the government. The panel dealing with the succession issue recommended on October 25, 2005, amending the law to allow females of the male line of imperial descent to ascend the Japanese throne. On January 20, 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi devoted part of his annual keynote speech to the controversy, pledging to submit a bill allowing women to ascend the throne to ensure that the succession continues in the future in a stable manner. Shortly after the announcement that Princess Kiko was pregnant with her third child, Koizumi suspended such plans. Her son, Prince Hisahito, is the third in line to the throne under the current law of succession.

They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380\u00a0km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270\u00a0km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports , the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year.

Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the Military Service Act in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of Military Service Tribunals to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916.

Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with D\u00edaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries Pascual Orozco and Francisco Villa disagreed and went ahead with an attack on Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively and on 21 May 1911, the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was signed.

The siege signalled the pinnacle of the Ottoman Empire's power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. Thereafter, 150 years of bitter military tension and reciprocal attacks ensued, culminating in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, which marked the start of the 15-year-long Great Turkish War. The inability of the Ottomans to capture Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and established a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, \"The failure of the first  brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past.\" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman's main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of which  was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman's European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary.

Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in.

Four plays later, the Patriots put the game out of reach with a 1-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis, making the score 45-24. During the extra point and afterwards, the Lions were called for three personal fouls, including one on defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh.

This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the Burning of books and burying of scholars of 212 BC, the Han dynasty (202 BC\u2013220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for Chinese pagoda towers, engineering, surveying, and includes material on right triangles. It created mathematical proof for the Pythagorean theorem, and a mathematical formula for Gaussian elimination. The treatise also provides values of \u03c0, which Chinese mathematicians originally approximated as 3 until Liu Xin (scholar) (d. 23 AD) provided a figure of 3.1457 and subsequently Zhang Heng (78-139) approximated pi as 3.1724, as well as 3.162 by taking the square root of 10. Liu Hui commented on the Nine Chapters in the 3rd century AD and Liu Huis \u03c0 algorithm accurate to 5 decimal places (i.e. 3.14159). Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD Zu Chongzhi computed Mil\u00fc to seven decimal places (i.e. 3.141592), which remained the most accurate value of \u03c0 for almost the next 1000 years.

PATCO strike in 1981.\" Most unions were strongly opposed to Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, despite the fact that Reagan remains the only union leader  to become President. On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization  union\u2014which had supported Reagan\u2014rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a $10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement. Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan  to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector. Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \"sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.\" Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise  fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers.

Surprisingly, the Titans took the lead early as rookie QB Vince Young ran 19 yards for a touchdown in what would be the first quarter's only score. In the second quarter, Tennessee expanded its lead to 10-0 on a 22-yard Rob Bironas field goal. Indianapolis cut the deficit with six minutes left in the third quarter on QB Peyton Manning's 13-yard touchdown strike to WR Marvin Harrison. However, Tennessee countered on Rob Bironas' 47-yard field goal, which gave the Titans a 13-7 lead going into the fourth quarter. Showing the resolve that allowed them to come from behind in their two previous games, the Indianapolis offense delivered what turned out to be the game-clinching score with only five minutes left in the fourth quarter on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne to give the Colts a 14-13 lead. That ended up being the final score after Vince Young could not convert on a hail mary pass in the end zone. With the win, the Colts stayed undefeated and expanded their lead in the AFC South to two games over second place Jacksonville. Peyton Manning finished the game 20 of 31 for 166 passing yards with 2 touchdown passes and one interception, and Vince Young finished with 63 passing yards on 10 of 21 pass attempts and threw one interception also.

In 1763, Great Britain in the Seven Years War led to the growth of the First British Empire. With the defeat by the United States, France and Spain in the War of American Independence, Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a Second British Empire based in Asia and Africa.  As a result, culture of the United Kingdom, and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide.  Politically, the central event was the French Revolution And its Napoleonic aftermath, 1793\u20131815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The Tories, who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury.  Culturally the Victorian era (Queen Victoria reigned 1837\u20131901) was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century, 1815\u20131914. The First World War (1914\u20131918), in alliance with France, Russia and the United States, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. The resulting League of Nations was a favorite project in Interwar Britain. However, while the Empire remained strong, As did the London financial markets, the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and especially the United States. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of Hitlers Germany in the late 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 opened the World War II. In the World War II 1939\u201345, France, the Soviet Union the U.S. joined Britain as Allies of World War II.

In 48 games, the Redskins led the series 24-23-1 and had won the last five meetings. The Chicago offense took on a Washington defense that excelled against passers, being ranked tenth in the category; Dashon Goldson led all defensive backs in tackles with 95, while Bashaud Breeland led the team in passes defended with 13. The Redskins defensive rush, which had 20 sacks in 2015, was led by Ryan Kerrigan, who has 6.5. Despite such performances, the Redskins rush defense was ranked 29th in yards per carry with 4.64 and 25th in average rushing yards at 124.2. Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears could exploit this with the three-man rushing attack of Matt Forte, Jeremy Langford, and Ka'Deem Carey. On defense, the Bears faced a Kirk Cousins-led offense that focuses on quick passes; Cousins completed a league-high 68.6 percent of his passes, with 7.1 yards per pass. One of Cousins' main targets was tight end Jordan Reed, who scored six touchdowns and led the Redskins in yards after the catch. Rankings-wise, the pass attack was ranked 17th in the league in passing yards per game and 16th for yards per play. Joniak states that the Bears had to force turnovers, and an area was on third down, as five of Cousins' interceptions had been on third down. The Bears won the coin toss and elected to defer. Washington recorded a 15-play, 80-yard drive en route to scoring on Alfred Morris' one-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted, the Redskins scored again with Cousins' fake read option leading to a three-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Chicago's woes continued when the offense began the next drive on their own seven-yard line, and despite reaching the Washington 49, Jay Cutler was strip-sacked by Trent Murphy, who recovered the fumble. The Redskins failed to capitalize on the turnover and punted; the following two drives also ended with punts. With 52 seconds left in the first half, the Bears took over at their own 42, and managed to score with 18 seconds left when Cutler threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Cousins kneeled once to end the half. After the Bears punted on the first drive of the second half, Cousins threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Reed. The Bears responded with Cutler's nine-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who managed to escape DeAngelo Hall and made contact with Goldson as he reached the endzone. The score was the Bears' first third quarter touchdown of 2015. Afterwards, Cousins' pass for Pierre Gar&#231;on was intercepted by Kyle Fuller, and the Bears took advantage with Forte's seven-yard touchdown run to tie the score. Dustin Hopkins gave the Redskins the 24-21 lead on the first drive of the final quarter with a 47-yard field goal. Five drives later, the Bears attempted a 50-yard field goal with 1:40 left in the game.

But midway through the first quarter, Malcom Brown and Patrick Chung shared a tackle of Kenneth Dixon in the end zone for a safety(the third by the Patriots' defense on the season). The Ravens forced the Patriots to punt, and, aided by a 40-yard gain from Joe Flacco to Kyle Juszczyk and a 15-yard pass interference penalty on Cyrus Jones, drove all the way to the Patriots 16, but Shea McClellin blocked Justin Tucker's field goal attempt. Following that, the Patriots covering 74 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Blount, his 14th, which tied him with Curtis Martin who had 14 for the 1995 New England Patriots. The Ravens reached Patriot territory on their following possession, too, but punted again. Aided by a 61-yard completion to White, the Patriots raced 89 yards in just eight plays with Brady finding Mitchell on a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 16-0. On the second plays of the Ravens next drive, McCourty intercepted Flacco at the Patriots 22 and returned it 40 yards to the Ravens 38, but official review ruled him down by contact at the Patriots 23. Despite this, the Patriots reached the Ravens 1-yard line, but Eric Weddle intercepted Brady(only his second interception of the season) and returned it 14 yards to the Ravens 10. Two possessions later, after Devin Hester returned a punt 12 yards to the Ravens 28, the Ravens reached the Patriots 28 and got on board with a 50-yard Tucker field goal with 0:11 seconds left in the half, making the score 16-3 at halftime. After forcing the Ravens to punt on the initial drive of the third quarter, the Patriots marched 65 yards to score on Brady's 19-yard pass to Bennett, increasing the lead to 23-3. A 6-yard run by Blount on the drive game him 1,005 yards for the season. However, the Ravens got back in the game with aide from the Patriots. While the Ravens offense continued it's ineptitude, Cyrus Jones muffed a punt with Chris Moore recovering at the Patriots 3. Two plays later, Flacco connected with Darren Waller for a two-yard touchdown pass, trimning the deficit to 23-10. Things got better for the Ravens with Matthew Slater fumbling the kick return and Shareece Wright recovering at the Patriots 22-yard line. Four plays later, Dixon caught a swing pass for an 8-yard touchdown, and all of a sudden the score was 23-17. After three consecutive punts, the Ravens, aided by a 47-yard catch by Breshad Perriman, reached the Patriots 12, but on 3rd-and-4 Flacco was sacked by Ninkovich for an 8-yard loss. Tucker finished the drive with a 38-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 23-20 with 6:35 remaining in the game. On the first play of the Patriots next drive, Brady found Chris Hogan wide open for a 79-yard touchdown, extending the Patriots lead to 30-20. That was Brady's 450th career touchdown pass and only Hogan's second career 100-yard receiving game. Yet, the Ravens were still in the game, driving to the Patriots 20-yard line, Tucker hit a 37-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 30-23 and giving the Ravens a chance. On the Patriots next drive, the Ravens brought the game to a 4th-and-1 with 0:13 remaining. Instead of punting, the Patriots went for the kill shot and got it with Blount's 3-yard run enabling the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game.

The King of Hungary, Louis I, had conquered Dalmatia from Venice and by 1379 Hungarian forces threatened Venice itself by land from the north.

Genoa's allies also included the Patriarch of Aquileia and Leopold III, the Duke of Austria. The danger on land seemed trifling to Venice so long as she could keep the sea open to her trade and press the war against the Genoese in the Levant.  Venice's allies, which included Bernab\u00f2 Visconti of Milan, gave her little help on this side, although his mercenaries invaded the territory of Genoa. The Milanese troops were indeed  defeated in September 1379 in the Val Bisagno.

The first quarter was a back and forth fight with the Patriots gaining the only edge on a Gostkowski field goal.  The second quarter saw both offenses gaining momentum with the Lions scoring the first touchdown in the game on a five-yard Jon Kitna pass to Mike Furrey with 13:44 remaining.  The Lions then expanded their lead with a field goal by Jason Hanson to lead 10-3.  The Patriots responded by driving down the field and scoring on a six-yard Dillon run to tie the game 10-10.  On the Lions' ensuing possession Kitna threw the first of his three interceptions for the afternoon to Samuel.  The Patriots then marched down the field and the first half ended on a 27-yard Gostkowski field goal.  The second half started with the Lions slowly moving the ball down the field for a field goal to even up the score again 13-13. Brady then threw an interception to Dr&#233; Bly, which gave the ball back to the Lions.  The Lions again were unable to get into the endzone and settled on another field goal for a 16-13 lead.  On the following possession, Heath Evans got tackled by Jared DeVries which was called as a safety, giving the Lions an 18-13 lead and possession.  The Lions once more could not score a touchdown and took another field goal to take a 21-13 lead.  The Patriots were not deterred, though, as on the next drive they were able to get Dillon into the endzone again and complete the two-point conversion with a pass from Brady to Brown.  With this touchdown, Dillon became only the 15th NFL player with more than 11,000 career rushing yards.  Following the kickoff came an onslaught of turnovers.  First Kitna threw an interception to Mike Vrabel to give the Patriots the ball and a chance for the lead, but Watson fumbled the ball after a reception which gave the ball back to the Lions.  Kitna then was sacked and fumbled which gave the ball once again back to the Patriots.  This turned out to be the definitive scoring drive as Dillon scored his third touchdown of the night, putting the Patriots ahead 28-21.  On the final drive for the Lions, Kitna again threw an interception to Vrabel, who suffered a minor injury on the play.

Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be cautious of Bob Sutton's 3-4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, the pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive. The Chiefs won the toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points late in the first quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17-3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs. With 7:51 left in the game and down 17-6, Cutler attempted to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with Cutler throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson in the corner of the left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler's pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. Cutler led the offense on an eight-play, 67-yard drive, concluding with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two-point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in the game. Smith reached the Bears' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine-yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66-yard field goal. However, Santos' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18-17 win. This was Chicago's first victory at Arrowhead since 1993 where the Bears won 19-17. Two team records were set during the game. After converting his second field goal of the game, Gould became the leader of the most points in franchise history with 1,168 points, surpassing Kevin Butler. The win was Cutler's 46th with the Bears, tying Jim McMahon for the most in team history.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Who scored the first touchdown of the game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}, "query_id": "eb9cd224-4836-45fc-8adc-15b4a66cdef3", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Chiefs"]}]}, {"question": "Which player attempted a 66 yard field goal?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Santos"]}, "query_id": "6915656c-d98e-4938-9e00-bdc4e967f034", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Santos"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Santos"]}]}, {"question": "What was the winning score?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["18"]}, "query_id": "dcbe63b8-be1d-465f-9efb-1bf7bbe9a59e", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["31-3"]}, {"number": "18", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "What was the losing total?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["17"]}, "query_id": "1ce4463e-39a1-4b8d-b6ca-643331827605", "validated_answers": [{"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "17", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many field goals were made in this game?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "29708a89-5223-4edd-be24-1128b7b7695b", "validated_answers": [{"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How long was the longest field goal attempt in this game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["66-yard field goal"]}, "query_id": "9012daf2-c89a-4eb0-b53e-db831f17e562", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["66-yard"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["66-yard field goal"]}]}, {"question": "How many points in total were scored?", "answer": {"number": "35", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "fbc24a20-7568-47ec-9618-5fc9dd052f23", "validated_answers": [{"number": "35", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "35", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many points did the Bears win by?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "636c2763-ba02-4db0-b2dd-a4abda571337", "validated_answers": [{"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "Who scored more points, Bears or chiefs?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, "query_id": "fca7116f-43b4-4fb3-95b9-350f39057dfa", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}]}, {"question": "Who scored the first points of the game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}, "query_id": "d52ba158-62a8-4e73-b04d-f0c69426ecf6", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Chiefs"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Ramik Wilson"]}]}, {"question": "Who scored the first points of the second half?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Robbie Gould"]}, "query_id": "2e8baded-df2d-4548-aced-7e80e08013ce", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Bears"]}]}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl's_Court"}, "nfl_1892": {"passage": "Hoping to break a two-game losing streak the Colts played on home ground for an Interconference duel with the Cowboys.

During the war-filled years of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, tax rates in Europe increased dramatically as war became more expensive and governments became more centralized and adept at gathering taxes. This increase was greatest in England, Peter Mathias and Patrick OBrien found that the tax burden increased by 85% over this period. Another study confirmed this number, finding that per capita tax revenues had grown almost sixfold over the eighteenth century, but that steady economic growth had made the real burden on each individual only double over this period before the industrial revolution. Effective tax rates were higher in Britain than France the years before the French Revolution, twice in per capita income comparison, but they were mostly placed on international trade.

On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels. In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that \"Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects\", had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns.

With 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with cornerback Aqib Talib returning an interception off Ravens' quarterback Joe Flacco 51 yards for a touchdown, in what was the Broncos' only touchdown of the game.

Religious freedom was secured for Lutherans through the Peace of Passau in 1552, and under the Cuius regio, eius religio  and Declaratio Ferdinandei  clauses of the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. Religious disputes between the Crypto-Calvinists, Philippists, Sacramentarians, Ubiquitarians and Gnesio-Lutherans raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century.

John tried to assuage his son with the lieutenancy of Navarre, but his son's French upbringing and French allies, the Beaumonteses, brought the two into conflict. In the early 1450s they were engaged in open warfare in Navarre. Charles was captured and released; and John tried to disinherit him by illegally naming his daughter Eleanor, who was married to Gaston IV of Foix, his successor. In 1451 John's new wife, Juana Enr\u00edquez, gave birth to a son, Ferdinand. In 1452 Charles fled his father first for France, later for the court of his uncle, John's elder brother, Alfonso V at Naples.

Both sides had victories and losses, but by the middle of summer the Red Army was larger than the White Army and had managed to recapture territory previously lost. Following the abortive offensive at Chelyabinsk, the White armies withdrew beyond the Tobol. In September 1919 a White offensive was launched against the Tobol front, the last attempt to change the course of events. However, on 14 October the Reds counterattacked, and thus began the uninterrupted retreat of the Whites to the east. On 14 November 1919 the Red Army captured Omsk. Adm. Kolchak lost control of his government shortly after this defeat; White Army forces in Siberia essentially ceased to exist by December.

Greek nobles, Manthos Papagiannis and Panos Stolikos, Nevertheless revolutionary actions began after Papagiannis' death in 1596. Spanish conspirators, with instructions from Naples, led an action to spark revolt in southern Albania. They decided to invite archbishop Athanasius I of Ohrid in their plans. He was described as \"discrete and intelligent\". In the beginning, Athanasius was uninvolved, until the beginning of 1596 when he offered his cooperation to the Venetian official in Corfu. Athanasius sent a letter to the provveditore and captain of Corfu, Angelo Basadonna, in January 1596, about wanting to meet up and discuss \"very important things\". The two had a meeting on 26 January 1596, during which Athanasius spoke of the \"miserable state of Christians\" and asked for help for a general uprising. Rejected by Venice, he openly joined the Spanish conspirators, who contacted the Napolitan deputy about this. Athanasius sent his minister to Naples to ask for weapons and 2,000 soldiers from Spain, and to establish the whole plan of the uprising. The Napolitan vice-king sent one of his captains to oversee events and to get to know the real intents of the people. While the Napolitan captain was in Albania, the Himariotes south of Valona immediately rose up. The Himara revolt was part of a range of anti-Ottoman movements in the Western Balkans at the end of the 16th century during the Long Turkish War in areas that extended from Epirus up north to the area of \u0160ibenik .", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Who were the first people interested in a revolt?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Manthos Papagiannis and Panos Stolikos"]}, "query_id": "21ea6665-ca72-4041-bb25-c1d6225f6170"}, {"question": "How many years span these events?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["26"]}, "query_id": "13c3d339-90f5-49e8-9bcc-374d106f1e09"}, {"question": "What event happened first, the northern region of Epirus being organized, or Athanasius sending a letter about wanting to meet up and dicuss important things?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["northern region of Epirus were", "organized in the 1570s"]}, "query_id": "8287a892-0969-413d-b3d4-4e0698a479b8"}, {"question": "What event happened first, the northern region of Epirus being organized, or Athanasius sending his minster to Naples to ask for weapons?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["northern region of Epirus were", "organized in the 1570s"]}, "query_id": "3ec3549e-10ff-475e-abb5-6b6e593f1a66"}, {"question": "Which happened first, plans to overthrow Ottoman rule or Papagiannis' death?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["plans to overthrow Ottoman rule"]}, "query_id": "4f98b019-b50a-44f8-8253-a3f1a0a1b84d"}, {"question": "What date did Athanasius and Angelo Basadonna meet?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "26", "month": "January", "year": "1596"}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "da6b00d4-6318-45b6-ab2f-d81651238760"}, {"question": "What was organized in the 1570's?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Conspiracy plans"]}, "query_id": "b0e806a0-121e-4248-962f-9e2139233f20"}, {"question": "How many groups of people were apart of the Conspiracy plans?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "12062d52-c1fb-445a-bffb-240731a3f751"}, {"question": "Which people took part in the Conspiracy plans?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Greek nobles", "Manthos Papagiannis", "Panos Stolikos"]}, "query_id": "09d1e45e-8bbc-4f48-ae80-847670942490"}, {"question": "What sparked the revolution?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Papagiannis' death"]}, "query_id": "2727d9de-c14b-4cf3-9678-0107d0564160"}, {"question": "Around how many years after the Conspiracy Plans were made did the revolution start?", "answer": {"number": "26", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "387f2e5d-f73f-44b9-a166-47d4247bdae3"}, {"question": "How many things was the minister  sent to Naples to ask for?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "bf984180-c709-4a7b-8698-cab2874c2ca2"}, {"question": "How many different factions planned to overthrow Ottoman rule?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "25f517d3-ea28-4f88-a9c6-23ecd022b778"}, {"question": "What happened first: Papagiannis' death or Athanasius sent a letter?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Papagiannis' death"]}, "query_id": "92e8beda-cb7a-401f-b927-a10a4203385a"}, {"question": "What happened second: Papagiannis' death or Athanasius sent a letter?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Athanasius sent a letter"]}, "query_id": "1f5dd351-de30-4a4c-a014-3d4f720f75c5"}, {"question": "Which of the Greek noble organizers died before his plans came to fruition?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Manthos Papagiannis"]}, "query_id": "b51af7d3-899d-4ab9-82ac-7932a23d46a4", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many Greek nobles originally were involved in the plans?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "4bed5e2b-4595-4c10-b2a3-2e5d5efbe428", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "history_790": {"passage": "In early 1858, Simpson was ordered to join the Army's reinforcements for the Utah War.

Upon his arrival at Camp Floyd, he was directed to open a new road between that post and Fort Bridger. Simpson and his team also surveyed the military reservation at Fort Bridger, at Camp Floyd and in the Rush Valley. In May 1859, he headed an expedition to survey a new route from Camp Floyd  across the Great Salt Lake Desert of Utah and through the Great Basin to Genoa, Nevada near California. The Army contracted Frederick Lander to immediately to develop the more direct route to California for use by wagons, and Simpson's survey was later published in 1876. Simpson's Central Route played a vital role in the transportation of mail, freight, and passengers between the established eastern states and California, especially when hostilities of the Civil War closed the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route that ran along the southern border states. George Chorpenning immediately switched to Simpson's route to run his existing mail and stage line, and the Pony Express used it as well. In 1861 the Transcontinental Telegraph was laid along the route, making the Pony Express obsolete.

Since 2001, the Redskins had won five of the previous seven meetings, including the last four games. However, the Redskins were 0-2 at home in 2013, and were hoping to avoid going 0-3 at home since 1998. The Bears' third-ranked scoring offense was a potential factor against the Redskins' defense, which allowed 395.0 yards and 28.6 points per game, two of the worst percentages in the league. On offense, Jeff Joniak writes that Chicago had to protect Jay Cutler and the ball, as Washington's 3-4 defense led to 75 quarterback blitzes, eight sacks, two interceptions, and four touchdowns. On the defensive side, the Bears looked to contain Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III and the read option. Additionally, the Redskins recorded 399.2 yards per game, the fourth best in the NFL. In the special teams phase, the Bears' 23 kick returns were a league-high, which led to an NFL-leading 24.6 yard starting spot. Meanwhile, the Redskins struggled the previous week against the Dallas Cowboys, allowing Dwayne Harris to score on an 86-yard punt return, and allowing him to return a kickoff 90 yards; they ranked last in the league in punt coverage with 19.1 yards allowed per return and 28th in kickoff coverage with 26.4. In the punting game, Adam Podlesh showed improvement in his punting hang time, with five of 26 punts returned, the second-fewest in the NFL. For Washington, punter Sav Rocca had the lowest gross and net averages in punting, and was one of seven punters to have a punt blocked in 2013. The Redskins struck first with Kai Forbath's 38-yard field goal, which was answered by Robbie Gould's 47-yarder. On Washington's ensuing drive, Griffin was intercepted by Charles Tillman, who returned the pick to the Redskins' 10-yard line, which set up Matt Fort&#233;'s two-yard touchdown run. In the following quarter, Roy Helu scored on a 14-yard run to tie the game, and Washington pulled ahead after Brian Orakpo intercepted Cutler, scoring on the 29-yard return. Cutler later tore a groin muscle after getting sacked by Chris Baker, and Josh McCown took his role. Afterwards, Devin Hester returned a punt 81 yards for the touchdown, tying Deion Sanders' record for the most return touchdowns all-time with 19. However, the Redskins ended the first half as the leader after Griffin threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Reed. On the Bears' first drive of the second half, Gould missed a field goal wide right, but Chicago compensated for the miss with Fort&#233;'s 50-yard touchdown run. Washington ended the third quarter with Helu's three-yard touchdown run to lead 31-24. On Chicago's next drive, the Bears were forced to kick a field goal after blitzes rendered the Bears unable to score a touchdown. Afterwards, the Bears successfully converted an onside kick, but were offsides, and were forced to kick off. Fort&#233; scored again on a six-yard run, which Griffin answered with a 45-yard touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson. The Bears then pulled ahead with McCown's seven-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. With 3:57 left, the Redskins successfully reached the Bears' three-yard line, where Helu scored again with 45 seconds remaining. On the final play of the game, McCown was sacked by Barry Cofield and Ryan Kerrigan, ending the game with a 45-41 loss. The game marked the first time in team history that the Bears have allowed 21 points or more in their first seven games, and the first time since 1969 that Chicago has allowed at least 40 points in two consecutive away games. Cutler was projected to be out for the next four weeks, with McCown serving as his replacement. Statistics-wise, Cutler struggled, completing 3 of 8 passes for 28 yards with one interception and an 8.3 passer rating, while McCown completed 14 of 20 passes for 204 yards with one touchdown and a 119.6 passer rating. On the ground, Fort&#233; became the first Bears running back since Rashan Salaam to score three rushing touchdowns in a game.

The Oxus civilization was a Bronze Age Central Asian culture dated to c.\u20092300-1700 BC and centered on the upper Amu Darya . In the Early Bronze Age the culture of the Kopet Dag oases and Altyndepe developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at Namazga-Tepe. Altyndepe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown. The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age c.\u20092300 BC, corresponding to level V at Namazga-Depe. This Bronze Age culture is called the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex . The Kulli culture, similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilisation, was located in southern Balochistan  c.\u20092500-2000 BC. Agriculture was the economical base of this people.

The Bucs also featured three former Bears starters in quarterback Josh McCown, cornerback Isaiah Frey, and safety Major Wright. The Bears entered the game leading the all-time series 36-18, and won the last meeting 24-18 in 2011. The Bears' 13th-ranked offense (19th rushing and 10th passing) had to prepare for a 27th-ranked Tampa Bay defense (22nd rushing and 30th passing) that was tied for fourth in forcing plays of negative yardage with 75, 45 of which were runs, the third-most in the league. To prevent such incidents, the team would have to contain Gerald McCoy and Lavonte David, who recorded three pick-sixes (tied for the most in the league), 15 turnovers and 45 points on these plays. On defense, the Bears would have to apply pressure: when blitzed, the Buccaneers' quarterbacks have the second-worst statistics in the league, consisting of a 57.6 passer rating, four touchdowns, seven interceptions (McCown being responsible for four) and nine sacks. While the Bears' pass defense is ranked 15th compared to Tampa's 19th-ranked passing attack, and the cornerbacks are undersized compared to the Bucs' receiving tandem of Mike Evans and Vincent Jackson, both of whom are 6&#160;ft 5&#160;in (1.96&#160;m), the defensive backs are accustomed to such disadvantages in practice. Rushing-wise, Tampa was struggling productively, being ranked 28th, and had the NFL's second-least carries, and averaged only 3.2 yards on first down. ESPN, Yahoo!, USA Today, Fox Sports, and CBS Sports' majority panels predicted a Bears victory.

This time it was Dona Catarina, a Kandyan princess who had been entrusted to the care of the Portuguese and brought up in a Catholic European style. She was then aged ten or twelve. Pedro Lopes de Sousa led a force of about 20,000 in an invasion of Kandy, of which one thousand were Portuguese troops , 15,400 native Lascarin allies, 47 elephants used as pack animals, and the remainder Badaga mercenaries from India and coolie labourers. The initial number of opposing Kandyan forces is unknown, but is estimated at 10,000. The defenders held a distinct advantage in the terrain, as Kandy is a mountainous region and the invading force would be forced to traverse well-defended mountain passes. The Portuguese stormed the pass at Balana with heavy losses, after which the Kandyan forces began to retreat before the invaders. The Portuguese were able to enter the capital Kandy without resistance, finding it abandoned by King Vimaladharmasuriya I. Dona Catarina was crowned as the new ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy. However she and her Portuguese advisers were unpopular rulers, particularly after rumours spread that she was to be married to a Portuguese husband . Vimaladharmasuriya's forces engaged in guerilla tactics, attacking Portuguese foraging parties and cutting off lines of supply and communication. A large Portuguese-Lascarin raiding party of 3,000 men was surrounded and destroyed in the Uva region. Shortly thereafter, evidence was found that Jayavira Bandara Mudali, one of the Lascarin chieftains, was preparing to betray the Portuguese to Vimaladharmasuriya.

"Chad Pennington returned under center for the Jets, as they attempted to get their first win of the season against another winless team, the Miami Dolphins. The Jets' offense got going toward the end of the first quarter with a three-yard touchdown pass from Pennington to Laveranues Coles. The Dolphins responded swiftly as Trent Green and Ronnie Brown led the team on a three-minute drive that culminated on a one-yard run by Brown to tie the score at seven. However, the Jets wasted little time reclaiming the lead. Leon Washington received the ensuing kickoff at the two-yard line and returned it 98&#160;yards for a touchdown and a 14-7 lead. The Dolphins crept back with field goals of 31 and 39&#160;yards by Jay Feely on their next two possessions. Pennington kept the Dolphins at bay with a successful two-minute drill, finding tight end Chris Baker on a four-yard touchdown to close the first half and give the Jets a 21-13 halftime lead. The Jets attempted to further their lead opening the third quarter, but were stopped short of the goal line and had to settle for a 21-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Dolphins tried to respond, but the Jets' defense forced their first takeaway of the season on the ensuing drive, an interception by Kerry Rhodes. Pennington led his offense downfield with the help of several Thomas Jones running plays before he ran into the end zone to give the Jets a 31-13 lead early in the fourth quarter. Miami would not go down quietly, however. Green quickly marched the Dolphins downfield to set up Brown's two-yard touchdown run. The Dolphins elected to attempt a two-point conversion to cut their deficit to ten; using a Statue of Liberty play, Brown walked into the end zone to complete the conversion. Although the Jets shed several minutes off the clock on their following possession, the Dolphins got the ball back and again were able to move swiftly downfield, where Brown scored his third touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Green. The Dolphins needed to recover an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff to have a chance to tie or win the game, but, despite a penalty moving the ball up ten yards, were unsuccessful, and Pennington knelt out the clock to give the Jets their first victory of the season.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many wins do the Jets have this season?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "",

Liberia was a major exporter of iron ore on the world market. In the 1970s and 1980s, iron mining accounted for more than half of Liberia's export earnings. Since the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1980, the country's economic growth rate has slowed down because of a decline in the demand for iron ore on the world market and political upheavals in Liberia. Following a peak in growth in 1979, the Liberian economy began a steady decline due to economic mismanagement following the 1980 coup. This decline was accelerated by the outbreak of civil war in 1989; GDP was reduced by an estimated 90% between 1989 and 1995, one of the fastest declines in history. The United Nations imposed sanctions on Liberia in May 2001 for its support to the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front  in neighboring Sierra Leone. These sanctions have been lifted following elections in 2005. Upon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate, reaching 9.4% in 2007. The global financial crisis slowed GDP growth to 4.6% in 2009, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world.

died of his injuries, the Redskins tried to snap a three-game skid at home against the Buffalo Bills. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. For the team's first defensive play, they would come out with only 10 players on the field, as their honor to Taylor. In the first quarter, the Redskins took the early lead as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins increased their lead as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got on the board as linebacker Angelo Crowell sacked quarterback Jason Campbell in his end zone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half as Suisham kicked a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills drew closer as kicker Rian Lindell managed to get a 38-yard field goal. Later, the Redskins responded with running back Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Bills ended the half as Lindell kicked a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Bills drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, along with a 33-yard field goal. Later, the Bills got into position to kick a 51-yard field goal. They got the kick, but Head Coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. When the Bills tried to kick again, Gibbs called timeout again, but unintentionally got his team an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty which not only moved the Bills 15 yards closer to their end zone but reduced Lindell's field goal attempt to 36 yards.

During the first quarter, the Redskins appeared to be in the position to score after Fred Smoot intercepted Tarvaris Jackson and returned the interception deep into Viking territory. However, the Redskins' offense was unable to score a touchdown. Mike Sellers appeared to score a touchdown on 4th and goal, but a replay challenge by Brad Childress nullified the touchdown and gave the Vikings the ball. However, the Redskins immediately tackled Tony Richardson in the end zone for a safety. Following the subsequent free kick, the Redskins marched down the field and took a 9-0 lead on a 33-yard pass from Todd Collins to Chris Cooley. In the 2nd quarter, the Redskins expanded their lead to 16-0 on a 32-yard pass from Todd Collins to Santana Moss. Later in the quarter, the Redskins took a 22-0 lead when Clinton Portis took a handoff from Todd Collins and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El in the end zone. Although the Redskins were not successful on the 2-point conversion attempt, they had a commanding lead at this point in the game, and the previously rowdy Metrodome crowd was very disheartened and silent at this point. The Redskins stretched their lead to 25-0 on a 26-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. Later in the quarter, the Vikings got the crowd back in the game when Tarvaris Jackson threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jim Kleinsasser, cutting the Redskins' lead to 25-7. The Vikings further cut into the Redskins' lead around the 10-minute mark of the fourth quarter when Tarvaris Jackson scored on a 6-yard run, making the lead 25-14. The Metrodome crowd began sensing a comeback as momentum appeared to turn in the Vikings' favor. This came to a head midway through the fourth quarter when the Redskins appeared to complete a long pass to Santana Moss. Though initially ruled a catch by a referee on the sideline, the call was considered questionable by the game's announcers since Moss had to drag his toes to stay in-bounds as he caught the pass. Sensing an impending challenge by Childress, the Redskins raced down the field to snap the ball&#8212;since a play cannot be challenged after the ball has been snapped for the next play. However, the snap was fumbled and it appeared to be Vikings' ball after it was recovered by Vikings' defensive tackle Kevin Williams. As the Vikings rushed onto the field to take over on offense, coach Joe Gibbs challenged that Minnesota had twelve defensive players on the field at the time the Redskins snapped the ball and fumbled it. After review, Gibbs' challenge was upheld and the call on the field was reversed&#8212;a five-yard penalty was assessed to the Vikings for having too many men on the field and the Redskins maintained possession. After the Redskins had retain possession of the football they had eventually scored on a 13-yard touchdown run by Clinton Portis, making the score 32-14 capping off a 75-yard drive. Although Tarvaris Jackson later scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 32-21, the Vikings were unable to score again, and the Redskins emerged with a victory.

The Texans began their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts, a division rival in which they had only beaten once ever. However, Houston got off to an early 13-0 lead after 30 and 49-yard field goals from Neil Rackers (who had recently replaced Kris Brown as the team's kicker) and a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Schaub, leading passer in the league a year ago, to Kevin Walter. As expected, the Colts wouldn't go down without a fight as Indy scored ten unanswered points to close out the half on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to Reggie Wayne and a 20-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri. With the momentum seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, Houston took nearly eight minutes off the third-quarter clock with a 15-play drive (13 rushes) out of the locker room, as Arian Foster scored from a yard out, his first of three touchdowns on the day. Going into the fourth with Houston leading 20-10, the Texans continued to run, and the Colts continued to pass, as Peyton Manning attempted 57 passes that day, completing 40, a career-high. However, it wouldn't be enough; even though the Colts scored two touchdowns on a 10-yard pass to Dallas Clark and a 73-yard pass to Austin Collie, the Texans would score two of their own: 25 and 8-yard runs from Arian Foster en route to a 34-24 Houston win at Reliant Stadium. Arian Foster finished with 231 rushing yards on 33 carries. Both were Houston records for a game, and the 231 yards was the second most rushing yards on opening week, only behind O.J. Simpson. Peyton Manning eventually went 40/57 for 433 yards and three touchdowns. Houston began the season 1-0 and won for only the second time against Indianapolis, against fifteen losses.

During the first year of the German occupation , the navy assisted the occupying German forces with minesweeping, because of the political demand of keeping the infrastructure  up and running. The tensions between the German soldiers and the Danish armed forces rose slowly and, on 29 August 1943, they managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships, while Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels. This was due to a secret order, given directly to the captains by word of mouth by commander of the navy, Vice Admiral A. H. Vedel \"to try to flee to the nearest neutral or nazi-opposed port. If that was not possible, the ship should be scuttled at as deep a location as possible\". The Germans later succeeded in raising and refitting 15 of the sunken ships. A number of vessels had been ordered to attempt to escape to Swedish waters, and 13 succeeded. The fleet flagship, Niels Juel, attempted to break out in the Battle of Isefjord but the crew was forced to beach and partly scuttle her. The score for the larger vessels was therefore: 32 vessels were sunk, 2 were in Greenland, 4 reached Sweden, 14 were captured by the Germans. As for the smaller vessels: 9 \"patruljekuttere\" reached Sweden, 50 others were captured by the Germans. By the autumn of 1944, these ships officially formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile.

rival, the New England Patriots. In the week prior to the game, first-year Jets head coach Rex Ryan placed a phone message to all Jets season ticket holders asking them to \"make it miserable for (Tom) Brady and company,\" following up on his comments during the off-season that he would not \"kiss Bill Belichick's Super Bowl rings.\" He told the Jets fans that \"the Patriots had a better head coach and a better quarterback,\" but that the game would decide \"who has a better team.\" Meanwhile, Jets safety Kerry Rhodes said the Jets intended on not just winning, but \"embarrassing\" the Patriots in the game, while nose tackle Kris Jenkins called it the Jets' version of the Super Bowl; the Jets had not defeated the Patriots at home since 2000. On the first drive of the game, without an injured Wes Welker, the Patriots drove to the Jets' 36-yard line before having to punt. The Jets' first play from scrimmage was a strip-sack of rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez by defensive lineman Mike Wright; Sanchez recovered the fumble at the Jets' 3-yard line. On 4th-and-24, the Jets punted back to their own 49-yard line; the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position and went three-and-out. However, Jets running back Leon Washington fumbled on the next play; cornerback Leigh Bodden recovered it at the Jets' 17-yard line. Two holding penalties would push the Patriots back to the Jets' 37-yard line, setting up a 45-yard Stephen Gostkowski field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots moved to their own 41-yard line before Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a pass intended for Randy Moss at the Jets' 16-yard line. The Jets offense would continue to struggle, however, going three-and-out again to end the first quarter. The Patriots began the second quarter with a 9-play, 53-yard drive, one that stalled at the Jets' 7-yard line; the Patriots settled for another Stephen Gostkowski field goal, extending their lead to 6-0. The Jets would pick up their initial first down of the game on their next possession, going 52 yards on 10 plays before a Jay Feely 33-yard field goal cut the Patriots' lead in half. Starting from their own 10-yard line after a holding penalty on Sam Aiken on the kickoff, the Patriots took nearly six minutes off the clock, reaching the Jets' 11-yard line before two incomplete passes by Brady prevented the Patriots scoring their first touchdown of the game. Instead, Gostkowski kicked his third field goal of the day to increase the Patriots' lead to 9-3 going into halftime. Receiving the opening kickoff of the second half due to their deferral of the opening coin toss, the Jets took the lead in barely a minute. Following a 43-yard kick return by Washington, Sanchez hit wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery for 45 yards and a play later connected with tight end Dustin Keller on a 9-yard touchdown pass. The 10-9 lead was the first for the Jets over the Patriots at home since 2001. After a Patriots three-and-out, punter Chris Hanson's 30-yard punt gave the Jets the ball at the Patriots' 45-yard line. From the Patriots' 6-yard line, Sanchez appeared to throw a touchdown pass to Chansi Stuckey, but the catch was overturned after the Patriots challenged. Two plays later, Feely hit his second field goal of the day to give the Jets a 13-9 lead.The Patriots' ensuing possession reached the Jets' 35-yard line on a third down, but back-to-back delay of game penalties on Tom Brady, an incomplete pass, and a face-mask penalty on Moss on the punt backed the Patriots up to their own 40-yard line. However, Hanson's subsequent attempt was better than the first, nullified by the penalty, and the Jets began their next drive from their own 15-yard line. On a 14-play, 63-yard drive that spanned into the fourth quarter, the Jets extended their lead to 16-9 on a 39-yard Feely field goal. The Patriots started their next drive from their own 15-yard line as well, but were unable to reach midfield before punting. A Jets three-and-out gave the Patriots another opportunity with five minutes remaining, but a Ben Watson holding penalty in the middle of the drive helped set up a 2nd-and-20 situation and eventually another punt. Just before the two-minute warning, Sanchez was sacked, but a penalty on BenJarvus Green-Ellis on the ensuing punt meant the Patriots had to start their last drive of the game from their own 10-yard line. After a Julian Edelman 18-yard reception began it, four straight in-completions ended the drive and the game. With the win, not only did the Jets improve to 2-0, but it also marked the first time that they defeated the Patriots at home since 2000. This also marked the first time that New England was held without a touchdown since December 10, 2006.

Baltimore added onto their lead in the second quarter as quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 9-yard and a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason.

Although shocked by the scale of the revolt and the speed of its approach, Henry VII had not been idle. The army of 8,000 men assembled for Scotland under the command of Giles, Lord Daubeny, Henry's chief general and Lord Chamberlain, was recalled. Then the Earl of Surrey was sent north to conduct a defensive, holding operation against the Scots until such time as the King had quelled his domestic difficulties. The Royal family  moved to the Tower of London for safety whilst in the rest of the City there was panic among the common citizens. It is said there was a general cry of 'Every man to harness! To harness!' and a rush of armed citizenry to the walls and gates. Then, the same day that the Cornish arrived at Guildford, Daubeney and his men took up position upon Hounslow Heath and were cheered by the arrival of food and wine dispatched by the Lord Mayor of London. The Crown decided to take the offensive and test the strength and resolve of the Cornish forces. Lord Daubeney sent out a force of 500 mounted spearmen and they clashed with the Cornish at 'Gill Down' outside Guildford on Wednesday 14 June 1497. The Cornish army left Guildford and moved via Banstead and Chussex Plain to Blackheath where they pitched their final camp, looking down from the hill onto the Thames and City of London.

Under  (r. 1216\u201372), Johns son, further concessions were made to the nobility, and royal power was diminished.

The game was a must-win for the Packers if they wanted to have any chance of getting the No. 1 seed and gain home-field advantage in the playoffs. On a 16-degree afternoon in Chicago, reserve RB Adrian Peterson ran for 102 yards from 30 attempts including and 8-yard run for a TD (only the second 100-yard game of his career and his first since 2005) while Garrett Wolfe also gained 67 all-purpose yards from the RB position. However, it was the Chicago special teams that really excelled in this game. After Green Bay previously going 12 years (929 punts) without a blocked punt, the Bears blocked Jon Ryan twice on a slippery afternoon. In the second quarter, Darrell McClover got his hand onto a Ryan punt but more damaging was Charles Tillman's charge down midway through the third quarter which allowed Corey Graham to pick up the football and run in 7 yards for a TD to put the Bears up 28-7. Kyle Orton, Lovie Smith's third-choice QB, went 8-for-14 for 101 yards including a 3-yard touchdown pass to Desmond Clark in the third quarter. It was also a good day for LB Brian Urlacher who ran home an 85-yard interception early in the fourth quarter, the first of his career.

With the #1 seed already wrapped up, the Cowboys had little to play for and rested many of their starters in the 2nd half. In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early with Redskins RB Clinton Portis getting a 23-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Washington increased its lead with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 46-yard field goal.  The Cowboys would respond with rookie kicker Nick Folk getting a 37-yard field goal, but the Redskins replied with Suisham kicking a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Washington continued to lead as Portis got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Redskins pulled away as QB Todd Collins completed a 42-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss.  Dallas would end the game with Folk nailing a 30-yard field goal. With the loss, the Cowboys ended the regular season at 13-3, along with the NFC's #1 seed. The Cowboys secured a bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs with an NFC best 13-3 regular season record. Fresh off a bye week, the #1 seed Cowboys hosted the #5 seed New York Giants in the Divisional round of the playoffs. The Giants were fresh off an upset win over the #4 seed Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tampa Bay in the Wild Card round. It would be the third time the NFC East division rivals faced off against each other that season, with the Cowboys winning the previous two matchups. The Giants took the opening kickoff and came out firing, hitting the Cowboys with a quick 52 yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Amani Toomer. The Cowboys and Giants would exchange punts on the next 2 series before the Cowboy marched 96 yards down the field, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Tony Romo to Terrell Owens (which was reviewed and upheld), tying the score at 7-7. The Cowboys never faced a 3rd down on the drive. With the 2nd quarter underway, the Giants would punt on the next series, giving the ball to the Cowboys at their own 10 yard line with 11:21 left in the 2nd quarter. The Cowboys would proceed to march methodically down the field in small chunks, as they burned up all but 61 seconds of the clock before Marion Barber bulled into the end zone on a 1-yard touchdown run, making it 14-7 in the Cowboys favor (the play was reviewed but upheld). With just 61 seconds left in the half, the Giants seemed to catch the Cowboys' defense napping as they quickly marched down the field from their own 29 yard line, stunning the Cowboys with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Toomer with 11 seconds left in the half. It was Manning and Toomer's 2nd touchdown connection of the first half. The game went into halftime with the score tied at 14-14. The Cowboys took the opening kickoff, and much like their last drive in the first half, proceeded to march very slowly down the field, gaining yards in small chunks. After a drop by tight end Anthony Fasano in the end zone, the Cowboys' long drive stalled out and they had to settle for a 34-yard FG from kicker Nick Folk, to make it 17-14 for the Cowboys. The drive took up over 8 minutes of the 3rd quarter. The next 2 series of the game resulted in punts. After a 25-yard punt return, the Giants had excellent field position at the Dallas 37 yard line. The drive went into the start of the 4th quarter, where Brandon Jacobs rumbled into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown, to make it 21-17 for the Giants. As the 4th quarter ticked on, both teams exchanged punts on the next 4 series. With 1:50 left in the game, the Cowboys took over on the Giants 48 yard line after a short punt return. They marched down to the Giants 22 yard line with 31 seconds left, still trailing 21-17. On 3rd and 11, with 21 seconds left, Romo lofted a pass into the corner of the end zone that dropped just in front of receiver Patrick Crayton, who had a couple steps on his defender. Replays showed that Crayton hesitated at the top of his route instead of running straight into the end zone, which is where Romo expected him. The pass fell incomplete as a result. Now on 4th down and 11, with just 16 seconds left, Romo heaved a desperation pass into the back of the end zone, into double coverage, which was intercepted by Giants cornerback R.W. McQuarters, effectively ending the game, 21-17 Giants. The 2007 Dallas Cowboy season ended in disappointment, after raising huge hopes with a spectacular 13-3 regular season, the best season for the Cowboys since their last Super Bowl season of 1995.

As a result, a back-arc basin center was created, which began to form the marginal basin which would become the Andaman Sea, the current stages of which commenced approximately 3-4 million years ago . The boundary between two major tectonic plates results in high seismic activity in the region .

This megathrust earthquake had a magnitude of 9.3. Between 1,300 and 1,600 kilometers of the boundary underwent thrust faulting and shifted by about 20 meters, with the sea floor being uplifted several meters. This rise in the sea floor generated a massive tsunami with an estimated height of 28 meters  that killed approximately 280,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean.

Defeated, the Tuscarora signed a treaty with colonial officials in 1718 and settled on a reserved tract of land in what became Bertie County. The first successful and permanent settlement of North Carolina by Europeans began in earnest in 1653.

However, the settlers increasingly encroached on Tuscarora land, raided villages to take slaves, and introduced epidemic diseases. After their defeat, most of the Tuscarora migrated north to New York where they joined their Iroquoian cousins, the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. They were accepted as the sixth nation.

With two games against opponents with losing records approaching, it was crucial for the Giants to escape this one with a win. The Eagles started things off right away, putting 14 points on the board before the Giants had run their fifth play from scrimmage. McNabb connected with Celek for a touchdown, and Sheldon Brown returned a Brandon Jacobs fumble for six points on the ensuing drive. In the second quarter, Nicks caught the longest reception of his short career for a 68-yard touchdown. After DeSean Jackson responded by returning a Jeff Feagles punt 72 yards for a touchdown, the Giants were able to send Bradshaw into the end zone from the 3. Eagles backup quarterback Michael Vick was able to sneak in one more rushing touchdown before halftime. Jacobs opened the scoring in the second half with a 1-yard rush. After the teams traded turnovers, Manning got the ball into Hixon's hands for a 61-yard touchdown. But the Eagles responded on the very next play with a 60-yard touchdown to Jackson. Jackson's 176 receiving yards amounted to the best individual receiving performance against the Giants since 2002. The Eagles struck again in the fourth quarter, this time on a run by fullback Leonard Weaver and a two-point conversion pass to Jason Avant. The Giants put another touchdown on the board (courtesy of Boss) in the last two minutes of the game, and got the ball back with 28 seconds left. But defensive end Darren Howard sacked Manning and forced a fumble, sealing the Eagles' first sweep of the Giants since 2004. The Giants had given up 85 points to the Eagles this year, the most they had ever given up to the Eagles in a single season in franchise history, including four playoff years where they met the Eagles a third time.

When Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducci\u00f3n. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducci\u00f3n town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many years was it estimated for the population to fall from 10,000 to 4,000?", "answer": {"number": "28", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "eb705bed-b0ae-4d2e-bc7b-2da1b03e5a47", "validated_answers": [{"number": "28", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "28", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "Which population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Acalan"]}, "query_id": "c438c440-274e-4cf2-aafb-520bfb23f40b", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["native populations"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Acalan"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Acalan"]}]}, {"question": "What were the settlements the Spanish established called?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["reducciones"]}, "query_id": "41f62cab-b500-47d4-bcd2-c362916072e0", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["reducciones"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["reducciones"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["reducciones"]}]}, {"question": "What was a danger of living in the coastal reducciones?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["contagious European diseases"]}, "query_id": "6270371f-e309-431a-ae33-f716cffb9c93", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["pirate attacks", "contagious European diseases"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["pirate attacks"]}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["vulnerable to pirate attacks"]}]}, {"question": "Which year had the largest population recorded, 1525 or 1553?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": "1525"}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "d7c261cc-b929-4a1c-81b8-55a4d5f6fdbb", "validated_answers": [{"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": "1525"}, "spans": []}, {"number": "1525", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": "1525"}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many years did it take for the population to decrease to about 1100 from 10000?", "answer": {"number": "36", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "eed072dc-4fb6-4002-a5ca-7957b756c3f8", "validated_answers": [{"number": "36", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "36", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many more people were estimated to live in Acalan in 1525 than were recorded in 1553?", "answer": {"number": "6000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "3b62074d-0508-4bf0-8912-9a3001525895", "validated_answers": [{"number": "6000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "6000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many years after the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel did the Spanish record only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants?", "answer": {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "7eceb91e-539d-432b-be92-ffbd31e389ed", "validated_answers": [{"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many years after Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s passed through Acalan and estimated the population of at least 10,000 was the population recorded to be around 4000?", "answer": {"number": "28", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "e0263687-e0f1-4867-933c-636f5c94d929", "validated_answers": [{"number": "28", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "28", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}, {"question": "How many more people lived in Acalan in 1525 compared to 1553?", "answer": {"number": "6000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "c2115e30-fe10-428d-8e9f-81765a5feec6", "validated_answers": [{"number": "6000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "6000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl's_Court"}, "nfl_267": {"passage": "Attempting to capitalize on their decisive victory at Atlanta, a revitalized Saints team entered the game with high hopes.
