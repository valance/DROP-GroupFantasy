While Skanderbeg was preparing his ambush, the Ottoman Turks under Ali Pasha arrived and encamped opposite his forces. The night before the battle, the Ottomans celebrated the coming day, whereas the Albanians extinguished all their campfires and those who were not on guard were directed to rest.

With the convincing victory, Tampa Bay clinched the NFC South division title, maintained a perfect 5-0 division record, and scored their first kickoff return touchdown in franchise history. Tampa Bay's defense recorded the first points of the game, as Ronde Barber intercepted Chris Redman's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. Atlanta got on the board next with kicker Morten Andersen making a 33-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Micheal Spurlock made team history by becoming the first Buccaneer player to return a kickoff for a touchdown. It was the first kickoff return touchdown for Tampa Bay in 32 seasons, 498 games, and 1,865 attempts. After the Buccaneer defense forced a Falcons punt, Jeff Garcia commandeered a long, clock-eating 10-minute drive ending in a 33-yard field goal by Matt Bryant to make the score 17-3. With just over five minutes remaining in the first half, Tampa bay recovered an Atlanta fumble, and Earnest Graham scored a 1-yard TD run. Graham became the first player in club history to score a touchdown in six consecutive games. With a 24-3 lead, Tampa Bay performed a pooch kickoff, and Atlanta muffed the return, while Kalvin Pearson recovered. Tampa Bay drove to the 24-yard line, but DeAngelo Hall intercepted a pass intended for Joey Galloway at the Atlanta 11-yard line. The Buccaneers would immediately regain possession as Greg White forced and recovered a fumble on the next play. Matt Bryant then easily converted a 28-yard field goal to take a 27-3 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay would receive the second half's opening kickoff, but was forced to punt after a 7-minute drive. On Atlanta's third play, Jermaine Phillips intercepted a pass intended for Jerious Norwood which set Tampa Bay up at the Atlanta 23-yard line. Matt Bryant then scored the half's first points with a 34-yard field goal to make the score 30-3. In the fourth quarter, punter Josh Bidwell successfully pinned Atlanta at their own 6-yard line. The resulting poor field position eventually led to Tampa Bay taking over near midfieldied Michael Bennett carried six times all the way to the Atlanta 1-yard line, from which Anthony Becht scored the game's final points off a 1-yard TD catch.

With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar.

After a Patriots three-and-out, the drove to the Patriots 49, but Hillis was stripped by Mayo and Meriweather recovered at the Patriots 36. The Patriots couldn't move the ball though and punted. Early in the fourth quarter, the Patriots marched 79-yards in 11 plays, scoring on Brady's two-yard touchdown pass to Hernandez off of a deflection, trimming the deficit to 10-7. However, Cleveland countered with a 9 play, 60-yard drive, scoring on an 11-yard touchdown run by Chansi Stuckey on an end-around, extending the lead to 17-7. The Patriots drove to the Browns 9, but after catching a 6-yard pass, Gronkowski was stripped at the 3-yard line with Abram Elam recovering at the 2. The Browns took a knee and led 17-7 at halftime. Following a Patriots punt, the Browns marched 72 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 16-yard touchdown run by Colt McCoy, increasing the Browns lead to a stunning 24-7. The Patriots reached the Browns 49 on their next drive, but a holding penalty on Gronkowski killed the drive as their offensive struggles continued. The Browns marched all the way to the Patriots 20 on their next drive, and Dawson was good on a 38-yard field goal, putting the Browns up 27-7 early in the fourth quarter. The Patriots raced 69 yards in 14 plays on their next drive, scoring when Brady found Hernandez on another 1-yard touchdown pass, trimming the deficit to a manageable 27-14. The Browns reached the 39 in five plays, then Hillis burst through and took off for a 33-yard touchdown run, giving the Browns a 34-14 lead and sealing their shocking win. Hoyer stepped in for Brady on their next drive and was intercepted by Eric Wright on the second play at the Browns 40.

Patriots elected to practice at San Jos&#233; State University and to stay in Santa Clara, California in advance of flying to San Diego to face the Chargers in a Sunday night game at Qualcomm Stadium. On the first play of the game, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson that brought the Chargers to the Patriots' 32-yard line. Three incomplete passes by Rivers from the Patriots' 7-yard line set up a 25-yard Nate Kaeding field goal that gave the Chargers a 3-0 lead. On their first possession, the Patriots reached the Chargers' 31-yard line, where Gostkowski missed a 48-yard field goal, his first such miss of the season. Four plays later, Rivers hit wide receiver Malcom Floyd on a 49-yard touchdown catch that extended the Chargers' lead to 10-0. The Patriots punted on their ensuing possession; the Chargers' Darren Sproles returned the punt 28 yards to start the Chargers' next drive from the Patriots' 45-yard line. A failed third-down conversion by the Chargers set up a missed 44-yard field goal attempt by Kaeding. An exchange of punts early in the second quarter gave the Patriots starting field position at the Chargers' 43-yard line; seven plays later, Gostkowski hit a 47-yard field goal to cut the Chargers' lead to 10-3. After a Chargers punt set up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 6-yard line, the Patriots went three-and-out and a Jerod Mayo facemask penalty on the resulting punt gave the Chargers the ball at the Patriots' 31-yard line. Four plays later, Rivers extended the Chargers' lead to 17-3 on a 4-yard pass to Jackson. The Patriots began their next drive with a Marques Harris strip-sack of Cassel that was recovered by offensive tackle Mark LeVoir; the Patriots then ran out the clock to end the first half. Starting from their own 22-yard line to begin the second half, the Patriots drove to the Chargers' 1-yard line on eight-straight Cassel passes or scrambles, the last of which was a 28-yard catch by Morris. However, the Chargers denied the Patriots the final yard needed for the touchdown on three straight downs, and on fourth down from the 1-yard line, Cassel was sacked to turn the ball over on downs. A 59-yard reception by Jackson on the second play of the Chargers' next drive as well as a 32-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Hobbs brought the Chargers to the Patriots' 1-yard line, where tight end Antonio Gates caught a 1-yard pass from Rivers that extended the Chargers' lead to 24-3. On the next play from scrimmage, Cassel was intercepted by cornerback Quentin Jammer, giving the Chargers the ball on the Patriots' 26-yard line; Kaeding would later hit a 35-yard field goal to give the Chargers a 27-3 lead. A three-and-out by the Patriots on their next possession led to a 13-play, 77-yard Chargers drive that ended with the Patriots not allowing the Chargers past the Patriots' 5-yard line on three straight plays. On fourth down, Kaeding completed a 23-yard field goal that made the score 30-3 in favor of the Chargers early in the fourth quarter. The Patriots' next drive spanned six plays and lost two yards total, ending in a 23-yard Hanson punt on 4th-and-25. However, the Chargers gave the ball right back to the Patriots on the first play of their ensuing possession, a fumble by running back Jacob Hester. Starting from the Chargers' 46-yard line, the Patriots drove to the Chargers' 1-yard line on seven plays, four of which were Faulk runs, and then scored on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run that cut the Chargers' lead to 30-10 with just over five minutes to play in the game.

Carolina starting quarterback Jake Delhomme sat out the game with an elbow injury, and was replaced by David Carr. The Buccaneer offense started the game with an exhausting, 11-play, 71-yard drive, capped off by a 3-yard scramble by Jeff Garcia for a touchdown. With 3 minutes left in the first quarter, running back Carnell Williams blasted down the field for an 18-yard run, but his right leg buckled, seriously injuring his knee. As he was being carted off the field, nearly the entire Buccaneers team, along with several Panthers players, huddled around Williams in support. After the injury timeout, Earnest Graham salvaged the drive with a one-yard touchdown run. Tampa Bay extended their halftime lead to 17-0 after a Matt Bryant field goal, meanwhile, Carolina's offense was sputtering, blasted by the Buccaneers defense, who sacked Carr three times, and intercepeted him once. Carr completed only 19 of 41 pass attempts, and Carolina was facing their first shutout in five seasons. With 23 seconds left in regulation, Carolina finally got on the board with a touchdown pass to DeAngelo Williams. An onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Buccaneers won their third straight game. Through four games, the Buccaneers had not given up any points in the first quarter, and quarterback Jeff Garcia had not thrown an interception. After the game, the Buccaneers announced that running back Carnell Williams (torn patellar ligament) and left tackle Luke Petitgout (torn ACL) would both face season-ending surgery. On Wednesday, October 3, linebacker Barrett Ruud was named the NFC Defensive Player of Month for September with a league-leading 51 tackles, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, and one

previous week, the Patriots prepared to take on the team with the number one overall defense in the NFL: the Chicago Bears.  This game marked the first game the Patriots played on the new FieldTurf at Gillette Stadium.  Turnovers dominated the entire game as both teams turned the ball over a total of nine times; in the first half alone Benjamin Watson caught a Tom Brady pass at the Bears' 1-yard line but was hammered and the ball popped into the Bears' hands; later Laurence Maroney was stripped of the ball in the Bears redzone; the Bears for their part surrendered a Rex Grossman interception by Asante Samuel and a Grossman fumble in the Pats' redzone.  The Patriots scored first with a one-yard Maroney run in the second quarter.  The Bears responded with a field goal with 4:04 remaining.  The half ended with Gostkowski making his longest field goal of the season and his career with a 52-yarder to make the score 10-3.  In the second half, running back Cedric Benson scored the Bears' next touchdown with a two-yard run with 14:53 remaining in the game. The touchdown came after a defensive pass interference penalty call that resulted in a 45-yard gain for the Bears.  The Patriots responded by marching down field and scoring on a Brady touchdown pass to Watson to make the score 17-10; this drive was highlighted by a nine-yard first-down run by Brady in which he faked out Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher.  After another defensive pass interference penalty that gave the Bears 1st and 10 at the New England 18-yard line, the Patriots second-ranked defense stopped the Bears. limiting them to a field goal, putting the score at 17-13 with 3:31 left.  The game closed on a Dillon fumble which gave the Bears one final chance to drive down field, but quarterback Rex Grossman threw his third interception of the night to cornerback Asante Samuel. The Patriots then knelt down to end the game and improve their record to 9-3. The three interceptions by Samuel were the most interceptions by one player in one game since Roland James in 1983.

When Danish king Eric opened the Baltic trade routes for Dutch ships and introduced a new toll for all foreign ships passing the \u00d8resund , six Hanseatic cities  declared war, put a naval blockade on Scandinavian harbours and allied with Eric's enemy Henry IV, count of Holstein. Therefore the war was intensively linked with the Dutch-Hanseatic War , the Kalmar War with Holstein  and the Swedish revolt . After years of changing fortune in warfare Rostock and Stralsund signed a separate peace agreement in 1430. L\u00fcbeck, Hamburg, Wismar and L\u00fcneburg, however, continued the war and assisted Holstein to conquer Flensburg in 1431. Thereafter they agreed an armistice in 1432 and started peace negotiations. Meanwhile an anti-Danish revolt broke out in Sweden . In 1434 Eric had to agree an armistice with the Swedes, too. In April 1435 he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein, followed by the peace of Stockholm with Sweden a few months later the same year. The Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues but they had to accept Dutch competition in the Baltic trade. The Danish Duchy of Schleswig was ceded to the count of Holstein. Sweden's autonomous rights and privileges were extended. These peace agreements weakened Eric's position dramatically, and in 1439 he got dethroned by Danish, Swedish and Norwegian Privy Councils.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many years did the

fight against Home Rule. Also in 1913, the Irish Citizen Army was founded by the trade unionists and socialists James Larkin and James Connolly following a series of violent incidents between trade unionists and the Dublin police in the Dublin lock-out. In June 1914, Nationalist leader John Redmond forced the Volunteers to give his nominees a majority on the ruling committee. When, in September 1914, Redmond encouraged the Volunteers to enlist in the British Army, a faction led by Eoin MacNeill broke with the Redmondites, who became known as the National Volunteers, rather than fight for Britain in the war. Many of the National Volunteers did enlist, and the majority of the men in the 16th  Division of the British Army had formerly served in the National Volunteers. The Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army launched the Easter Rising against British rule in 1916, when an Irish Republic was proclaimed. Thereafter they became known as the Irish Republican Army . Between 1919-21 the IRA claimed to have a total strength of 70,000, but only about 3,000 were actively engaged in fighting against the Crown. The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War, but there were a number of exceptions such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle.

Long live the Federation of Soviet states of the world! Long live the world revolution!\" Most of the uprising was quelled in a few hours. In Schiffbek, it lasted till just past noon.

It is unclear whether they had their own structure during the Latin Era or if they were under the Latin Church of Cyprus, as has been the case since the Ottoman Era.

In 1794 the small Armenian Catholic community of Larnaca was granted some holy chalices from the auction of the belongings of the old Capuchin monastery of the town. It was during the British Era that the Armenian-Catholic community increased in number, due to the arrival of a large number of refugees from the Armenian Genocide. In 1931, there were about 200 Armenian-Catholics in Cyprus most of them became attached to the Latin places of worship, especially the Holy Cross cathedral in Nicosia and Saint Joseph's convent in Larnaca; between 1921-1923, the latter housed a small Armenian-Catholic school, run by Abbot Jean Kouyoumdjian - who served at the convent between 1921-1928. In 1960, there were less than 100 Armenian-Catholics. However, their number decreased in the following years, due to emigration to other countries and assimilation with the Armenian-Cypriot, the Latin-Cypriot and/or the Greek-Cypriot community.

Among the players the Bears faced was former returner and receiver Devin Hester, who had recorded 19 his NFL-record 20 return touchdowns with the team. Atlanta entered the game with the second-best passing offense in the league, with the receiver duo of Julio Jones and Roddy White having combined for 56 catches for 765 yards and five touchdowns. The former also led the league with 40 receptions and 552 yards. Hester, despite being 23rd in the NFL with 15.1 yards on 14 receptions, was one the Bears had to be prepared when he was used as a slot receiver. Among the goals the Bears' defense had was to rush Matt Ryan, who - despite being pressured often and tied with Jay Cutler with 130 pass attempts - was one of five quarterbacks with an average of eight yards per pass. Altogether, the Falcons had the third-best offense in yards gained, first in yards per play with 6.58, second in red zone touchdown percentage, and third with 29 points per game. However, the Bears offense could attack the Falcons' 28th-ranked rushing defense, which had been allowing 147.6 yards per game; the Bears had been recording 116 rushing yards each game. In addition, Atlanta had allowed a league-leading ten rushing touchdowns and six yards per play, while having the second-worst sacks per pass attempt with 2.47 percent, and was one of five teams allowing 400 yards per game. On special teams, Chicago would have to watch out for Hester, who recorded one of the league's four punt return touchdowns in 2014, while recording an average of 14.4 yards off eight punt returns, and was ranked eighth in the league with a kick return average of 24.2 yards. The Falcons were predicted by every CBSSports.com analyst to win, and were the -3.5 favorite. Brandon Marshall, Danny McCray, and Tim Jennings served as the Bears' captains, while Sherrick McManis, Ahmad Dixon, Shea McClellin, Lance Briggs, Jon Bostic, D. J. Williams, and Jermon Bushrod were inactive. After the Bears won the coin toss, elected to receive, and punted on the first drive, the Falcons scored on their first drive with Matt Bryant's 52-yard field goal. After the Bears punted again, Jones was stripped by Kyle Fuller, but recovered; the Falcons would also punt. On Chicago's next drive, Cutler, after spiking the ball, was drilled by Paul Worrilow, allowing the Bears to gain a first down at the Falcons' 14-yard line; the drive lasted into the second quarter, and ended with Robbie Gould's 25-yard field goal; the Bears extended the lead on their next drive via Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The Falcons would be forced to punt again, with Chicago scoring off Gould's 28-yard field goal, the final scoring play of the first half, the Bears leading 13-3. After receiving the ball in the second half, the Falcons drove to Chicago's 41-yard line, where Ryan threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to Antone Smith, and the Falcons tied the game on their next possession off Bryant's 54-yard field goal. On Chicago's drive, the Falcons failed to provide safety assistance at the right side of the field, leading to Cutler throwing a 74-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, completing it to the Falcons' five-yard line, with Matt Forte scoring on the next run, though Gould's extra point would be blocked by Ra'Shede Hageman. Now down by six, the Falcons failed to score, and were forced to punt. In the final quarter, the Bears reached the Falcons' eight-yard line, where Cutler threw a touchdown pass to Jeffery. However, the score would be nullified by Jeffery stepping out of the endzone on the play. On the next play, Martellus Bennett fought to the nine-yard line, where Forte scored on the rushing touchdown. The Bears then scored on the two-point conversion with Cutler's pass to Bennett, putting the Bears up by 14 points, 27-13. On Atlanta's next drive, Jared Allen recorded his first sack as a Bear, and would later be forced to punt, and the Bears would also punt. Afterwards, Ryan's pass for Jones would be intercepted by Demontre Hurst, though the Bears would have to punt. The Falcons' final drive ended with a turnover on downs, and Cutler would kneel thrice to end the game. The Bears became the first team to win 750 total games. It took only 4 road games for the Bears to match their road win total from last season (the Bears were 3-5 on the road during the 2013 season).

In 1633, however, Chickatabot died in a smallpox epidemic that decimated nearby Neponset, Narragansett and Pequot communities. Because Chickatabot and Pynchon's deal left no written deed, the Massachusetts General Court ordered \"those Indians who were present when Chickatabot sold lands to Mr. Pynchon, or who know where they were, to set out the bounds thereof\". Fifty years later, Chickatabot's grandson Josias Wampatuck brought a land claim against Medfield and the other towns created within the borders of the Chickatabot purchase, for which he received payment. Of those lands, Dedham was the first town formed. Dedham was incorporated in 1636, and Medfield  was first settled in 1649, principally by people who relocated from the former town. The first 13 house lots were laid out on June 19, 1650. In May 1651, the town was incorporated by an act of the General Court as the 43rd town in Massachusetts. The Rev.

After a 21-yard Cassel pass put the Patriots in the Bills' red zone, a 13-yard Cassel touchdown scramble gave the Patriots a 7-0 lead. Following an exchange of punts, an errant Edwards throw was intercepted by Hobbs to begin the Patriots' next drive from the Bills' 34-yard line.

The Bills' drive reached as far as the Patriots' 4-yard line on 2nd-and-goal, but the Patriots' defense did not allow Bills running back Marshawn Lynch any positive yardage on two straight runs. A 25-yard Rian Lindell field goal then cut the Patriots' lead to 10-3.

The ensuing 13-play drive culminated with a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal that gave the Patriots a 13-3 lead. An exchange of punts gave the Bills the ball at their own 19-yard line to begin their next drive, which advanced to the Bills' 45-yard line before Edwards' second interception of the day, this one to O'Neal, gave the Patriots the ball back at their own 41-yard line for the final play of the fourth quarter. Five plays later, Cassel was sacked for the only time in the game at the Bills' 44-yard line by defensive lineman Marcus Stroud and safety George Wilson; Stroud forced a fumble in the process and Wilson recovered it at the spot of the sack.

The use of the long count is best attested among the classic Maya, it is not known to have been used by the central Mexican cultures.

After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Mark Spitzs seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400 m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was the talking point. He claimed the 100 m and 200 m events in times outside his best, making it the first time that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet since 1999. He also experimented by adding the 100 m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second. This earned him a Commonwealth spot in a seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.          By this time, Thorpes relationship with Frost was beginning to unravel. Thorpe had always insisted that his swimming was about enjoyment and improving himself in setting faster times, rather than victory or defeat. This contrasted with Frost, who had a more aggressive and combative mindset, often making bold public statements. Thorpe ignored Frosts advice and bulked up his upper body by a further 5 kg to 105 kg, making him the heaviest elite swimmer in history. His reasoning that the strength gains would outweigh any loss in flexibility raised concerns over his physiological strategy. On the first night in Manchester, Thorpe again lowered his Swimming at the 2002 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Mens 400 metre freestyle by 0.09 s to 3 min 40.08 s, before anchoring the 4 \u00d7 100 m freestyle relay team to another gold.

At this point the Ottoman command grew complacent and stopped pursuing the retreating Wallachian army, focusing instead on fortifying T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte and Bucharest and considering their task all but done.

The Battle of Giurgiu in particular was devastating for the Ottoman forces, which had to retreat across the Danube in disarray. The war between Wallachia and the Ottomans continued until late 1599, when Michael was unable to continue the war due to poor support from his allies. The turning point of the war was the Battle of Mez\u0151keresztes, which took place in the territory of Hungary on October 24-26, 1596. The combined Habsburg-Transylvanian force of 45-50,000 troops was defeated by the Ottoman army. The battle turned when Christian soldiers, thinking they had won the battle, stopped fighting in order to plunder the Ottoman camp. Despite this victory, the Ottomans realized for the first time the superiority of Western military equipment over Ottoman weapons.

divisional rivals, the Detroit Lions. Both teams went into the game with 0-2 records, hoping to move away from the bottom of the division standings. Deep into the 1st quarter, Vikings QB Brett Favre continued his interception-throwing form, as he was picked off by Lions DT Corey Williams while attempting to throw a short pass to RB Toby Gerhart. Williams set off on a run, but Gerhart recovered to bring him down at the Minnesota 12-yard line. Three short plays later, Detroit had the ball in the end zone, QB Shaun Hill finishing off the drive with a 5-yard pass to TE Tony Scheffler. The Vikings were forced to punt the ball away on their first drive after the touchdown, but Detroit PR Stefan Logan fumbled while attempting to catch the ball, which was recovered by Vikings LB Chad Greenway 24 yards from the Detroit goal line. With the first play of the drive, Favre threw a 24-yard pass to WR Percy Harvin, who made a diving catch for the game-tying touchdown. Detroit's next drive resulted in a missed field goal, allowing the Vikings to go 66 yards back down the field for a touchdown, finished off by a 6-yard run from Adrian Peterson. With a minute left in the first half, Favre was picked off yet again, as his throwing arm was hit by Lions DE Cliff Avril, giving Alphonso Smith a simple interception. The Lions drove 36 yards into the Minnesota half, and Jason Hanson ended the 2nd quarter with a field goal from 33 yards. Minnesota began the second half with the ball and took 10 plays to get into the Detroit red zone; however, the Detroit defense stood firm and the Vikings were limited to a 31-yard field goal from Ryan Longwell. The Lions managed to get back into the Minnesota half on their next possession, but they went 3-and-out on the Minnesota 41-yard line before punting into the end zone for a touchback. On the very next play, Vikings HB Adrian Peterson broke a career-long 80-yard run for a touchdown to put Minnesota 24-10 up. On Detroit's next possession, a sack on 3rd-and-20 by Vikings DE Brian Robison on QB Shaun Hill sparked a mass brawl between the two teams. As the defense made their way off the field, Brett Favre was seen giving them vigorous verbal encouragement. Midway through the 4th quarter, Minnesota RB Toby Gerhart fumbled the ball in a tackle, and it was recovered by Detroit FS Louis Delmas. The Lions then drove back down the field from their own 22-yard line to within 4 yards of the Minnesota end zone in just under 5 minutes. However, on 1st-and-goal, Vikings LB Ben Leber intercepted Shaun Hill's attempted pass to RB Maurice Morris inside the end zone before returning it to the Minnesota 18-yard line. The Vikings failed in their attempt to run the clock down to the two-minute warning and had to punt the ball away, giving the Lions one final chance to reduce their deficit. Beginning the drive at their own 38-yard line, they got to the Minnesota 10-yard line within seven plays, but CB Antoine Winfield intercepted Hill's attempt at another touchdown pass to Tony Scheffler inside the endzone for a touchback with only a minute to go. Brett Favre knelt the ball down to run out the clock and the Vikings picked up their first win of the regular season.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Who missed a field goal attempt?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Jason Hanson"]}, "query_id": "9fb426ee-2f23-4d29-84b9-81f580479be6", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many touchdowns did Adrian Peterson run for?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "55390717-2891-4b0c-b627-0934362bc99e", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the longest touchdown play?", "answer": {"number": "80", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "7dc4d9f8-6f86-4815-97fa-f18a1402f2d5", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many yards longer was Adrian Peterson's second touchdown over his first one?", "answer": {"number": "74", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "8625b76a-97c1-4656-99d3-e5c558e7f364", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Hanson miss in the second quarter?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "1e6f1b69-f94d-4f72-a673-10205c084e8d", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Hanson kick in the second quarter?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "ead74fd3-01c5-41cf-bd7f-4e4d527b303c", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Hanson kick in the first half?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "31f21c1c-b6a6-4316-af0f-cd9b04c2cad7", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Longwell kick in the third quarter?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "000578d3-559b-44b2-af46-5d1bf4906727", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Longwell kick in the second half?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "70c7c87e-e765-4598-83dc-94acd19c7480", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many touchdowns were there in total?", "answer": {"number": "5", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "64482aa0-bc01-4820-b4dd-29bfa69073d6", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the shortest touchdown run?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["80-yard"]}, "query_id": "0b0d6ee1-7f7f-49ae-a038-a28503c1f416", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the shortest touchdown run?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["6-yard"]}, "query_id": "0ff9527a-61e2-41be-8c14-5070eb04b327", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the longest field goal?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["38-yard"]}, "query_id": "6d04fb29-5513-4789-9bab-5f6dff7a24bd", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_76": {"passage": "For week eleven, the Chicago Bears returned to Giants Stadium to play the New York Jets.

The Redskins continued to win ugly and lose ugly to be 5\u20133 at the halfway mark. However, the Redskins would begin to collapse. The Washington Redskins lost their next three games to fall to 5\u20136. On Monday, November 26, 2007, Redskins superstar, Sean Taylor was shot by intruders early in the morning in his Miami home. The next morning, Sean Taylor died from severe blood loss.

Although the Bears led the all-time series 30-14-1, they had not defeated the Eagles since 2011, while also losing their most recent game in Philadelphia in 2013 54-11. To take on the Eagles defense, Jeff Joniak elaborated on using a rushing attack that ranked fifth in the league, along with keeping Mitchell Trubisky protected and scoring points; entering the game, the Eagles were allowing less than 19 points per game. Defensively, the Bears faced quarterback Carson Wentz, who led the league in touchdown passes with three, and an offense that ranked first in scoring; eleven different players on the Eagles had scored a touchdown in 2017. With Danny Trevathan and Leonard Floyd out due to injuries, the backups were also challenged by a rushing unit featuring LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi, which ranked second in the NFL. Philadelphia also succeeded in developing high margins of victory, winning by more than 15 points per game, and scoring at least 26 points in every game but their only loss in week two. Despite the stacked odds, as the Bears were able to defeat three perennial playoff teams in Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Carolina, Joniak wrote the team had to \"believe  can happen, and the longer they hang around, the more they will believe.\" The two teams traded punts to start the game, though the Eagles struck first on Wentz's 17-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz. On the first play of the Bears' next drive, Trubisky's pass to Tre McBride was batted and intercepted by Malcolm Jenkins, but Dion Sims stripped the ball away and McBride recovered to continue the series. Four plays later, the Bears punted, but got the ball back after the Eagles' first play of their drive; Blount broke free for a 35-yard run, but Adrian Amos forced a fumble and Sam Acho recovered. Chicago attempted to take advantage of the takeaway, but Cairo Santos' 54-yard field goal went wide right. A drive later, the Bears forced a three-and-out until a holding penalty on Prince Amukamara gave the Eagles a first down. Wentz later escaped a blitz from Cre'Von LeBlanc on third-and-nine to record a 16-yard run, followed by throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to Nelson Agholor, who escaped Eddie Jackson and Kyle Fuller for the touchdown. Later in the first half, Jake Elliott made a 45-yard field goal to increase the gap, and Wentz threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery with five seconds remaining to make the halftime score 24-0. During Chicago's first drive of the second half, Santos successfully kicked a 38-yard field goal to give the Bears three points, which followed with the defense stopping the Eagles on fourth down, but Philadelphia scored once again in the fourth quarter when Ajayi fumbled in the end zone and Agholor recovered the loose ball.

The recent discoveries indicate that early tin bronze was more common than previously thought, and developed independently in Europe 1500 years before the first tin bronze alloys in the Near East. The production of complex tin bronzes lasted for c. 500 years in the Balkans. Shortly before the end of the fifth millennium BC, there are no longer evidence for production of tin bronze. This coincides with the collapse of large cultural complexes in the Balkans.Tin bronze would be reintroduced to the area again some 1500 years later.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many total artifacts from Serbia and Bulgaria have been dated to before 4000 BC?", "answer": {"number": "15", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "86a327cc-7f62-40da-b19c-8fce2239766f"}, {"question": "Where did tin bronze develop first, in the Near East or in Europe?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Europe"]}, "query_id": "92ac01a8-4c2a-42c0-96c3-f2189ee82463"}, {"question": "How many artefacts from Serbia and Bulgaria are dated to before 4000 BC?", "answer": {"number": "15", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "a0cb6fcd-a60f-4e65-9ab2-9650ad97d6f3"}, {"question": "Based on the artifacts we have found thus far, who was first to develop tin bronze, Europe or the Near East?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Europe"]}, "query_id": "d93ea5fb-00b0-4719-934b-e956347dff26"}, {"question": "How many artifacts from Serbia and Bulgaria are dated before 4000 BC?", "answer": {"number": "11", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "c84c237e-19db-4fdb-b141-e93f8a0a7031"}, {"question": "What kind of tin bronze artifact is found in Serbia?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["The oldest securely dated"]}, "query_id": "02659220-fc47-4ced-b6a3-4c8c1740f13a", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "From which year is the The oldest securely dated tin bronze artifact", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": "4650"}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "d6311e06-a208-4f74-a1de-6f6be3a68963", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many countries can you find artifacts that are dated to before 4000 BC?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "1c6173a0-357c-4675-bfa7-b9356f7a5d9f", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "Where did tin bronze originate?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Europe"]}, "query_id": "54b1081c-83e0-481d-829d-c81103897d98", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "Which people coincide with the complex tin bronze no longer being in production?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Balkans"]}, "query_id": "9bb804a5-1f9d-4386-be4b-1a809bf5c0b1", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many tin bronze artefacts from Servia and Bulgaria are dated to before 4000 BC?", "answer": {"number": "15", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "73121197-caf4-47d2-8b34-dcb1c127c467", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many years were there from the introduction of complex tin bronzes till the reintroduction in Balkans?", "answer": {"number": "2000", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "f2d61e1d-847a-43d4-843b-17a0f0dcb19a", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "Which came first, tin bronze intoduction in the Balkans or in the Near East?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Europe 1500 years before"]}, "query_id": "e7e7d9fa-8b2d-4748-8a2c-8de1af58cf88", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_257": {"passage": "For Week 2, the Saints traveled to take on the Packers at Green Bay's Lambeau Field, where they had lost 52-3 last season.

Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their \"Wildcat\" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the \"Wildcat\" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots

hunger strike in mobilising support and winning elections led to what was referred to by Danny Morrison (writer) as, \"the Armalite and ballot box strategy\" with more time and resources devoted to political activity. The perceived stalemate along with British governments hints of a compromise and secret approaches in the early 1990s led republican leaders increasingly to look for a political agreement to end the conflict, with a broadening dissociation of Sinn F\u00e9in from the IRA. Following negotiations with the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and secret talks with British civil servants, the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire in 1994 on the understanding that Sinn F\u00e9in would be included in political talks for a settlement. When the British government then demanded the disarmament of the IRA before it allowed Sinn F\u00e9in into multiparty talks, the organisation called off its ceasefire in February 1996. The renewed bombings caused severe economic damage, with the 1996 Manchester bombing and the Docklands bombing causing approximately \u00a3800 million in combined damage. After the ceasefire was reinstated in July 1997, Sinn F\u00e9in was admitted into all-party talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The IRAs armed campaign, primarily in Northern Ireland but also in England and mainland Europe, caused the deaths of approximately 1,800 people. The dead included around 1,100 members of the British security forces, and about 630 civilians. The IRA itself lost 275\u2013300 members, of an estimated 10,000 total over the 30-year period. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA had detonated 19,000 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the United Kingdom, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it \"the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history\".", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "Which happened first, Irish hunger strike or the IRA called a ceasefire?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Irish hunger strike"], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "27d66919-f55f-4ebc-8428-047345f9447d", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "Which happened first, the Good Friday Agreement or the ceasefire was reinstated?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["the ceasefire was reinstated"], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "c6f28889-8c0a-422a-9d75-7d521a6e12c2", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more British security forces were killed compared to civilians", "answer": {"number": "470", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "2c0aca04-2a4c-45f3-a726-94e9ab16b565", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "Which occurred first, the Irish hunger strike or the Good Friday Agreement?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Irish hunger strike"], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "570c60c0-aa5a-4f1f-9522-b78395b7cec2", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many, on average, were improvised explosive devices detonated per week?", "answer": {"number": "10", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "ac626dd1-6a18-42b0-8b80-94455e9fe69b", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many years after the IRA ultimately called a ceasefire was the Good Friday Agreement produced?", "answer": {"number": "4", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "d34eff51-85ba-4ee5-8aa2-59a9c579f331", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "Who had the largest amount of deaths in the IRA armed campaign: British Campaign forces or civilians?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["British"]}, "query_id": "4c587255-7091-40a2-98a1-17c6816f2a08", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many years did the IRA detonated 19000 explosive devices?", "answer": {"number": "35", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "87cff98d-550d-4ff0-98d7-be51f2ede450", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_1920": {"passage": "Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Ravens the Dolphins played on home ground for an AFC duel with the Titans.

"wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_538": {"passage": "The Cleveland Browns traveled to Oakland for their first road game of the season to face the Oakland Raiders. Historically, the Browns and the Raiders split their all-time series at 27 games a piece heading into week three's game. The Browns had won six of their last seven meetings with the Raiders, but the team fell short by a final score of 26-24, allowing the Raiders to end their eleven-game losing streak. The Browns' first drive was marred by three penalties and a sack, forcing the team into an almost-impossible 3rd-and-40 situation. The Browns were forced to punt, but held the Raiders to a three-and-out series on their first drive. However, the Browns were forced to punt again on their second drive, and allowed the Raiders to score the first points of the game on a 32-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal, putting the Raiders up 3-0. The Browns' next drive ended prematurely, as quarterback Derek Anderson was intercepted by Raiders linebacker Thomas Howard, who returned the interception 26&#160;yards. The Raiders' next drive was stalled by the Browns, forcing the team to kick a field goal, this time a 22-yard field goal. The Browns were forced to punt again on their next drive, and the Raiders were able to score on a 41-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Josh McCown to wide receiver Ronald Curry. The score was made possible by a brilliant play-action fake, which caused rookie cornerback Eric Wright to bite on the fake, allowing Curry to run untouched to the endzone. The Browns' next drive was again ended by an interception, as Kirk Morrison picked Anderson off and returned the interception 45&#160;yards before being tackled by Braylon Edwards to save the touchdown. The Raiders were held to a field goal, this time 23&#160;yards, despite their outstanding field position, increasing their lead to 16-0. On the kickoff, however, returner Josh Cribbs managed to break down the Raiders' defense en route to a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown, putting the Browns on the board for the first time in the game. The Raiders then fumbled on their next possession, allowing defensive end Simon Fraser to fall on the loose ball. Anderson then led the Browns down the field to a 23-yard Phil Dawson field goal, bringing the Browns within six points as the first half came to a close. Raiders quarterback McCown was replaced by Daunte Culpepper at the start of the second half due to an ankle injury he sustained on a play in which defensive end Robaire Smith fell on his leg during a tackle. Culpepper's entrance into the game was met with a loud series of cheers from Raiders fans, who have wanted to see Culpepper on the field all year. His first drive leading the Raiders in the second half ended with a punt, but the Raiders held the Browns to a three-and-out, forcing another Browns punt. However, on the Raiders' next drive, a 24-yard pass from Culpepper to wide receiver Mike Williams was fumbled and recovered by cornerback Daven Holly. The Browns capitalized on the momentum from the fumble and scored six quick points on a 21-yard pass from Anderson to Edwards, bringing the Browns to within nine points of the Raiders. However, the Raiders' next drive culminated in a one-yard touchdown run by running back Lamont Jordan, increasing the Raiders' lead to 23-17 while taking more than nine minutes off the game clock. The Browns were forced into a three-and-out on their next possession, and allowed the Raiders to score three more fourth-quarter points on a 48-yard Janikowski field goal, capping the Raiders' scoring for the day at 26, putting them ahead 26-17. The Browns would answer back on their next drive as Anderson scrambled from the pocket and scored on a one-yard touchdown run to bring the Browns within two points of the lead. After a Raider punt, the Browns were forced into their two-minute offense and had to get the ball within field goal range to have a chance of winning the game. The Browns managed to get the ball to the Oakland 22-yard line, and the field goal unit took the field with three seconds left on the clock. Kicker Phil Dawson managed to hit the field goal from 40&#160;yards out; however, Raiders coach Lane Kiffin called a timeout just moments before Dawson kicked the ball, effectively icing his kick. With one more chance, the Browns lined up for the field goal again. This time, however, Dawson's field goal was blocked by Tommy Kelly, ending the Browns' chances for a comeback win. With the win, the Raiders ended their eleven-game losing streak and took the lead in the overall series between the two teams, 28-27. Derek Anderson, despite his somewhat disappointing performance, put up nearly 250&#160;yards passing for the second straight week, though running back Jamal Lewis was held to just 56&#160;yards on 15 carries. With the loss, the Browns have extended their already long streak of games without winning two in a row.

However, the Rams were also without starting quarterback Sam Bradford, and instead had Kellen Clemens as backup. The Bears had won four consecutive games against the Rams. Two rookie players the Bears' defense had to contain were running back Zac Stacy, who recorded an average of 107.7 yards and three touchdowns in the previous three games, along with ranking second among rookie running backs with 537 rushing yards; and receiver Tavon Austin, who recorded 314 yards against the Indianapolis Colts in the previous week. Additionally, the Rams' offense was ranked fourth in the NFL with 54.6 percent of yardage occurring after the catch. For the Bears' offense, Jeff Joniak wrote they needed to avoid attempting to score in the red zone; in the previous three games, the Bears had 12 drives in the red zone, but managed to score only four touchdowns, while also allowing a turnover, and was ranked 13th after scoring 55 percent. Meanwhile, the Rams had forced quarterbacks to record only a 45.8 passer rating when in the red zone, along with the second lowest completion percentage, and the third fewest completions recorded. Also, St. Louis led the league in red zone interceptions with six. Finally, the Rams led the league in overall sack percentage with 9.4, while defensive end Robert Quinn had the most knockdowns and hurries in the NFL, and was second in sacks with 12. An advantage Chicago had, however, was the second-most passing touchdowns in the NFL with 15, while Josh McCown's average gain per pass is higher than Cutler's, with a 7.47 to 7.20. The Rams also did not have the capable secondary to cover the trio of Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall. St. Louis scored first on Austin's 65-yard run, and would reclaim the ball after James Laurinitis stripped Matt Fort&#233;, leading to Stacy's one-yard touchdown run. The Bears would then score on McCown's seven-yard touchdown pass to Bennett, but the Rams ended the quarter with a 21-7 lead after Clemens' six-yard touchdown pass to Jared Cook. In the second quarter, McCown threw an incomplete pass, which appeared to be a fumble, and after Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson picked up the ball, Bears fullback Tony Fiammetta pulled him to the ground by the facemask. Kyle Long would then be involved in an incident with Rams defensive lineman William Hayes, which led to Long kicking Hayes, causing Long's brother Chris Long to restrain Kyle, who would then be penalized for a personal foul. McCown and Fiammetta would also be penalized, for intentional grounding and facemasking, respectively. Halfway through the quarter, Chicago scored after McCown threw a three-yard pass to Marshall, but Greg Zuerlein would score on a 29-yard field goal to give the Rams a 24-14 lead at halftime. The lone score of the third quarter was Zuerlein's 40-yard kick. Early in the fourth quarter, Hester recorded a 62-yard punt return for a touchdown, which was overruled by Craig Steltz's holding penalty. the Bears reached the Rams' one-yard line, but required eight plays: Michael Bush's run went for no gain; McCown's pass to Jeffery was incomplete, but a holding penalty on Brandon McGee gave the Bears a first down; Bush lost two yards on the following run; McCown's touchdown pass to Bennett was nullified by Jermon Bushrod's holding penalty; McCown's 13-yard touchdown pass to Fort&#233; was also nullified, after Fort&#233; failed to break the plane, instead placing the Bears back on the one-yard line; McCown was then sacked by Michael Brockers, but Brockers was penalized for roughing the passer; Bush failed to gain a yard on the next play; the Bears finally scored on the drive on Bush's one-yard run. On the Rams' ensuing drive, Benny Cunningham gained 27 yards, while the offense gained 48 yards from Clemens' 19 and 29 yards passes to Chris Givens and Cook, respectively. Four plays later, Cunningham scored on a nine-yard run, while Isaiah Pead scored on the two-point conversion. Devin Hester would fumble on the following kickoff, but recovered at the Bears' ten-yard line. After the Bears' offense reached their own 39-yard line, Quinn stripped McCown, and scored on the following fumble return. The game marked the third time the Bears allowed 40 points during the season for the first time since 1964. McCown set the team record for most completions with 36, two greater than Jim Miller's and Brian Griese's 34 set on November 14, 1999 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Fort&#233; recorded 77 yards in the game, adding to 6,178 career rushing yards, surpassing Neal Anderson to become the second-highest rushing leader in team history.

The relative quiet of the Tatar attacks on Russia in the late 30s and early 40s of the 17th century is undoubtedly due to the occupation of Azov by the Don Cossacks. The Russian government did not want to start a war with Turkey, did not send troops and after a long occupation the Cossacks left the town in 1642. The builders of the Belgorod Line and residents of the southern Russian districts, by the increase of Tatar attacks, immediately felt the change in the situation on the lower reaches of the Don. 3. In summer of 1633, 2000 Budjak Tatars invaded the southern Polish land and began to ravage Podolia. Crown Field Hetman Stanislaw Koniecpolski camping with the Polish army at Bar, led the 2000 cavalry against the Tatars and forced them to retreat. He then crossed the Dniester and on 4 July at the Battle of Sasov Rog on the River Prut defeated enemy. Poles captured several Budjak mirzas, among whom was the son-in-law of Cantemir Mirza, freed all the captives and captured a large part of the loot. In August Silistrian Pasha, Abaza Pasha, led the Turkish troops came to the Polish border and encamped near Khotin . Koniecpolski with a Polish army  went out to meet the enemy and established fortified camp near the fortress Kamenetz-Podolsky. Initially Abaza Pasha entered into peace negotiations with Koniecpolski. On 19 September the Budjak Horde  under Kantemir Mirza arrived to help Abaza-Pasha.

The game marked the third consecutive season game between the two teams and 36th all-time, with the Dolphins winning the last two games with an average margin of victory of 18 points. Miami opened the game with an impressive 80-yard drive after the opening kickoff, which lead to a quarterback Ryan Tannehill two-yard rushing touchdown. Two possessions later at the (3:28) mark in the first quarter, Oakland quarterback Carson Palmer threw a 64-yard touchdown to Mike Goodson tying the game. Through a majority of the second quarter both teams had a hard time moving across the 50-yard line, which was matched with impressive punting by both Dolphins punter Brandon Fields and Oakland punter Shane Lechler. By the end of the game Field punted the ball six times for 319 yards with an average yard per punt of 53.2 and Lechler punted the ball nine times for 422 yards with an average yard per punt of 46.9. However, Oakland managed to get the ball back with (3:33) left in the quarter and orchestrated a drive that ended with a Sebastian Janikowski 25-yard field goal. Both teams entered halftime evenly matched. It didn't take long following halftime for the Dolphins rushing attack to shine. On the second possession of the half the Dolphins drove the ball down field and allowed Reggie Bush to rush for a 25-yard touchdown. On the next Miami possession, after a quick pass from Tannehill to receiver Brian Hartline, Reggie Bush rushed 65 yards for another Miami touchdown. A few possessions later Oakland answered with a Janikowski 27-yard field goal. With little opposition from the Oakland defense Miami's offense kept the ball moving and managed to score on their next two possessions. Once with an Anthony Fasano 14-yard reception touchdown from Tannehill, the first of his career, and again with a Lamar Miller 15-yard rushing touchdown, the first of his career. Oakland tried to stop the bleeding on their next drive, but quarterback Palmer was intercepted by safety Reshad Jones.

Denver would answer in the second quarter as quarterback Kyle Orton connected with wide receiver Brandon Marshall on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New England would close out the half with Brady's 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Benjamin Watson. The Broncos would tie the game in the second half as kicker Matt Prater nailed a 24-yard field goal in the third quarter, followed by Orton finding Marshall again on an 11-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.  In overtime, Denver won possession and never relinquished possession as Prater booted the game-winning 41-yard field goal. With the win, the Broncos improved to 5-0 for the first time since the team's Super Bowl run of 1998.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many points did the Patriots score in the first quarter?",

The Bills answered with a Tyrod Taylor pass ro Sammy Watkins, a catch and run that went 47 yards for a TD.

On Philadelphia's first possession, Michael Vick was intercepted by Eric Berry, on a pass intended for Brent Celek, who returned it 38 yards for a touchdown. After a Chiefs punt, Michael Vick busted off a 61-yard run, setting up his 22-yard touchdown pass to Jason Avant. Zach Ertz attempted to run in the 2 pt. conversion, but failed, keeping the score 10-6. With less than a minute remaining in the first quarter the Eagles drove into Chiefs territory, but Vick was sacked by Justin Houston and fumbled. Two field goals by Ryan Succop was the only scoring of the second quarter, giving the Chiefs a 16-6 halftime lead. An Alex Henery field goal was the only score of the third quarter, giving the Chiefs a 16-9 lead entering the fourth quarter. On their first drive of the fourth quarter, Jamaal Charles capped off a 8 play, 62 yard drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, making the score 23-9. The Eagles immediately responded with a touchdown of their own, driving 78 yards with a 41-yard touchdown rush by LeSean McCoy, pulling to within 7. However, Kansas City struck the decisive blow with a 15 play, 73 yard drive, taking 8:15 off the clock and Ryan Succop adding his fourth field goals making the score 26-16.

Also, he hoped to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain. The conflict mostly consisted of military action aimed at League members, such as the Battle of Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise, though the Spanish launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking Doullens, Cambrai and Le Catelet and in the spring of 1596 capturing Calais by April. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597 the French crown laid siege until its surrender in September. With that victory Henry's concerns then turned to the situation in Brittany where he promulgated the Edict of Nantes and sent Belli\u00e8vre and Brulart de Sillery to negotiate a peace with Spain.

The Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348.

After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled area shrank back to the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin. Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords intermarried with Gaelic noble families, adopted the Irish language and customs and sided with the Gaelic Irish in political and military conflicts against the Lordship. They became known as the Old English, and in the words of a contemporary English commentator, were \"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\" The authorities in the Pale worried about the Gaelicisation of Norman Ireland, and passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish.

its dream of rebuilding the Pagan Empire. Instead, for the next six decades, it would struggle to hold on to its vassal states. Rebellions arose every time a new king came to power. The new king would have to reestablish his power all over again by gaining the fealty of all the vassal states, usually by show of force. Of these, the remote vassal state of Toungoo , tucked away in the southeastern corner across the Pegu Yoma range, proved most troublesome to successive kings at Ava. Toungoo lords rebelled against Ava in 1426-1440, 1451-1459 and 1468-1470, usually with Pegu's implicit or explicit support. Ava also faced rebellions at Mohnyin  and Prome . The beginning of the end of Ava came in 1480. The new king Minkhaung II was greeted with a multitude of rebellions but it proved to be different this time. The most serious rebellion was by his younger brother, lord of Yamethin. With a serious rebellion so close to Ava, vassal states broke away one by one. The Yamethin rebellion went on until 1500. In 1482, Minkhaung's uncle at Prome successfully revolted, the Prome Kingdom sprang into existence. Ava's vassal Shan states of Mohnyin, Mogaung, Momeik and Kale also broke away in the 1490s.

The outbreak of war with France earlier in 1793, following the execution of Louis XVI, forced the Society underground and toward armed insurrection with French aid. The avowed intent of the United Irishmen was to \"break the connection with England\"; the organisation spread throughout Ireland and had at least 200,000 members by 1797. It linked up with Catholic agrarian resistance groups, known as the Defenders, who had started raiding houses for arms in early 1793. To augment their growing strength, the United Irish leadership decided to seek military help from the French revolutionary government and to postpone the rising until French troops landed in Ireland.

In the first quarter, Green Bay's first possession, RB Ryan Grant fumbled the football and it was recovered by Dallas. Green Bay's defense responded by keeping Dallas out of the end zone and they had to settle for a 25-yard Nick Folk field goal. Green Bay moved the ball quite effectively the next drive, starting it off with a 26-yard completion to Greg Jennings. The drive ended when Aaron Rodgers was sacked for an 11-yard loss on 3rd down. The Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 36-yard field goal. The Cowboys next drive was fueled by a couple of long runs by RB Marion Barber. Dallas moved all the way down to Green Bay's 14, but on 3rd down Cowboy's QB Tony Romo threw a pass intended for TE Jason Witten and it was intercepted in the end zone by FS Nick Collins and returned to the Cowboy's 43-yard line. In the second quarter, Green Bay started off the quarter with some quick and effective short throws. The Packers managed to move the ball to the Dallas 20 without running the ball once on the drive. An Aaron Rodgers incomplete pass to WR James Jones on 3rd down set up a 38-yard Mason Crosby field goal. The Cowboys managed to get one first down on the next drive, but were stopped on 3rd down the next drive after Aaron Kampman and Cullen Jenkins teamed up for the sack on Tony Romo. Dallas punted and Green Bay went three and out with a couple of minimal runs by Ryan Grant and an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings forcing the Packers to punt. The Cowboys closed out the half with a RB Felix Jones 60-yard touchdown and a 39-yard Nick Folk field goal. The Packers were down 13-6 at the half. In the third quarter, Dallas received the ball first but were forced to punt 6 plays later. Green Bay's first drive of the second half started off with some solid runs by RB Brandon Jackson, but the highlight of the drive was 50-yard pass to Donald Driver on 3rd and 5 that set the Packers up with a 1st and goal at the Dallas 8. Aaron Rodgers was then sacked on 2nd and 3rd down and the Packers yet again were held to another Mason Crosby field goal. This field goal marked the 3rd time the Packers were shut down in the red zone and had to settle for a field goal in the game. On the Cowboy's next drive, Tony Romo completed a 63-yard pass to Miles Austin which set the Cowboy's up for a 2-yard Marion Barber touchdown extending their lead to 11 points going into the 4th quarter. In the fourth quarter, Dallas extended their lead to 18 points with a 52-yard Miles Austin catch and touchdown. Later in the 4th, RB Marion Barber fumbled the ball and it was recovered by CB Will Blackmon at the Green Bay 12-yard line. With Dallas playing a prevent style defense, Rodgers completed 8 of 10 passes down to the Dallas 1-yard line. Rodgers sneaked the ball into the end zone for the touchdown bringing the Dallas lead back down to 11 points. After the touchdown the Packers attempted an onside kick which was recovered by Tramon Williams but he was flagged for illegal touching and possession was awarded to Dallas along with a 5-yard penalty from the spot of the foul. Dallas moved the ball into field goal range but Romo threw an incomplete pass to Terrell Owens on 3rd down and followed it up with another incomplete pass to Jason Witten on 4th down giving the Packers the ball back. The Packers moved the ball slightly, but the drive ended when Brandon Jackson caught a pass on 4th down and ran out of bounds before the 1st down marker.

The classic French historiography often refers to Coalition troops three times more numerous than those of the King of France.

It is said by William the Breton, chaplain to Philip at the Battle of Bouvines, that the lines of soldiers stood in line in a space of 40,000 steps , which leaves very little clearance and predisposes to hand-to-hand fighting . William the Breton also says in his column that \"the two lines of combatants were separated by a pretty small space\". Philip Augustus had then launched an appeal to the municipalities in northern France, in order to obtain their support. 16 of the 39 municipalities of the royal demesne answered the call to arms.

home win over the Titans, the Patriots flew to Wembley Stadium in London for the year's NFL International Series game against the winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Five plays into the game, Buccaneers quarterback Josh Johnson was intercepted by Meriweather, who returned it 39 yards for a touchdown. On the ensuing drive, the Buccaneers advanced to the Patriots' 33-yard line before Meriweather again intercepted a Johnson pass, this time at the Patriots' 15-yard line; he returned this one 31 yards. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the turnover and went three-and-out. Following a Buccaneers punt, the Patriots began a drive with an end-around to rookie wide receiver Brandon Tate, who was active for his first NFL game after spending the first six weeks of the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list; the run went for 11 yards. Two plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 37-yard pass, which was followed a few plays later with a 14-yard Welker touchdown reception that gave the Patriots a 14-0 lead. After a penalty on the kickoff, the Buccaneers began their next drive at their own 11-yard line and could not advance one yard before punting; the 43-yard punt was returned by Welker 24 yards. Starting from the Buccaneers' 30-yard line, the Patriots moved to the 11-yard line before Brady was intercepted by safety Tanard Jackson in the end zone early in the second quarter. Following a Buccaneers three-and-out, Brady threw a short pass to Aiken that turned into a 54-yard scoring strike, extending the Patriots lead to 21-0. After another Buccaneers punt, Brady was intercepted by Aqib Talib on a deep pass intended for Brandon Tate; Talib returned it to the Buccaneers' 41-yard line. The 0-6 Buccaneers could not cross midfield though, and were forced into another three-and-out. On a 4th-and-2 from their own 46-yard line, the Patriots attempted a fake punt that was negated by a false start on Mankins; this set up a 26-yard Hanson punt. With less than three minutes remaining in the half, the Buccaneers drove into Patriots territory and then completed two passes to wide receiver Antonio Bryant; the second went for 33 yards and a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 21-7. The Patriots could not advance the ball on their ensuing drive and punted; two plays later, on the final play of the half, Butler intercepted Johnson at the Patriots' 11-yard line. The Patriots began the second half with a 10-play, 73-yard drive that was capped off with a 35-yard touchdown pass to Watson from Brady. After an exchange of punts, the Buccaneers embarked on a drive that extended into Patriots territory but stalled at the 37-yard line, resulting in a punt. This was followed by two more three-and-outs, before early in the fourth quarter the Patriots completed a 10-play, 89-yard drive with a 1-yard Maroney touchdown run, increasing the Patriots' lead to 35-7. After another Buccaneers punt, the Patriots advanced past midfield before punting after the two-minute warning. On an ensuing 4th-and-7 conversion attempt, Johnson was strip-sacked by Derrick Burgess to set up two Patriots kneeldowns to end the game. The Patriots bettered their record to 5-2 entering their bye week, while the Buccaneers remained winless at 0-7.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "how many passes did antonio bryant receive?", "answer":

the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut with a debt of $32,509,549.91. On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between $10 million and $50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth $4.4 million. Citing between $10 million and $50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jacksons bankruptcy lawyers elucidated the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding $20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing. His filings listed 32 entities that he has a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to rapper Rick Rosss ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal to come to fruition to his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than $2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the \"Sleek by 50\" headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing states that he owns seven cars valued at more than $500,000, including a 2010 Rolls Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of $108,000 a month include $5,000 for gardening along with a monthly income of $185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing says he also owes money to his stylist, his barber and his fitness coach. Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for $3 million and the other half for another $3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler & Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a $75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones and accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm of failing to \"employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case.\"", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many people does he owe money to?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "a98eac26-6e62-4fed-a28f-10817face689", "validated_answers": [{"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}]}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl's_Court"}, "history_692": {"passage": "After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority. With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace. Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum.

Carolina.  I-73 will begin where South Carolina Highway 22 (SC 22) starts at U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina near Briarcliffe Acres, South Carolina. It will then proceed northwest crossing the proposed routing of I-74 (currently South Carolina Highway 31, the Carolina Bays Parkway). After passing Conway, South Carolina, I-73 will leave SC 22 at a new interchange to be constructed  west of U.S. Route 701, and will then use a new highway to be built between SC 22 and South Carolina Highway 917 north of Cool Spring, South Carolina. I-73 will then use an upgraded SC 917 to cross the Little Pee Dee River. It will then proceed on a new freeway alignment between SC 917 and Interstate 95 in South Carolina that would have an interchange with U.S. Route 76 in South Carolina west of Mullins and then would proceed northwest to an exit with U.S. Route 501 near Latta, passing that city to the south before intersecting I-95 near South Carolina Highway 38. After crossing I-95, I-73 will use the chosen middle route, one of six potential alternative corridors that were studied all of which roughly paralleling SC 38 to proceed further north to the North Carolina state line. These alternative corridors were formally announced to the public on September 7, 2006, at a meeting in Bennettsville, South Carolina. The number of possible routes was reduced to three, and a final decision on the preferred northern route was announced on July 19, 2007. The central route caused the least disruption to homes, farms and wetlands. The North Carolina Department of Transportation and South Carolina Department of Transportation Carolina departments of transportation previously agreed to an I-73 corridor crossing the state line along SC  and NC 38 near Hamlet, North Carolina, on February 11, 2005.

It destroyed the native Irish Catholic land-owning classes and replaced them with colonists with a British identity. The bitterness caused by the Cromwellian settlement was a powerful source of Irish nationalism from the 17th century onwards. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, Charles II of England restored about a third of the confiscated land to the former landlords in the Act of Settlement 1662, but not all, as he needed political support from former parliamentarians in England. A generation later, during the Glorious Revolution, many of the Irish Catholic landed class tried to reverse the remaining Cromwellian settlement in the Williamite War in Ireland , where they fought en masse for the Jacobites. They were defeated once again, and many lost land that had been regranted after 1662.

After a Steelers three-and-out, on the Patriots first offensive play, Brady hit Chris Hogan for a 12-yard gain, but Hogan was stripped by Jarvis Jones, who recovered the ball at the Patriots 45. The Steelers drove to the Patriots 16, but on 3rd-and-6, Landry Jones was intercepted in the end zone by Malcolm Butler on a pass intended for Antonio Brown. Taking over at their own 20, the Patriots went on an 80-yard marathon, taking 13 plays, with Brady finding James White on a 19-yard touchdown pass. After the Steelers went three-and-out again, the Patriots marched 84 more yards, scoring on Blount's 3-yard touchdown four minutes into the second quarter, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. The Steelers countered on their next drive. Aided by Brown's 51-yard catch, they trimmed the score to 14-7 on a 14-yard touchdown catch by Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a Patriot three-and-out, a bad punt by Ryan Allen gave the Steelers the ball at the Steelers 47. Six plays later, Jones hit Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for a holding penalty on Chris Hubbard. On the next play Jones threw an incompletion and Chris Boswell missed a 42-yard field goal. The Patriots reached midfield on their next drive, but were forced to punt. Allen pinned the Steelers at their own 6, but the Steelers challenged that the ball hit the end zone, and the ruling was reversed giving the Steelers the ball at the 20. With the better field position, the Steelers drove 66 yards to the Patriots 14, and Boswell was good from 32 yards and the score was 14-10 Patriots at halftime. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 28 and Boswell made a 46-yard field goal, trimming the score to just 14-13. The Patriots countered, through, racing 75 yards in a mere 5 plays and Brady threw a 36-yard laser to Gronkowski for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 20-13, but Gostkowski missed his second extra point of the season. Justin Gilbert returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Steelers 42. Aided by the pretty good field position, Pittsburgh responded by driving 42 yards to the Patriots 26, and Boswell kicked a 44-yard field goal trimming the score to 20-16 on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Patriots countered again, racing 75 yards and Blount scored on a 5-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 27-16. The Steelers were forced to punt on their next drive, but Edelman fumbled and the Steelers recovered at the Patriots 43. The Steelers reached the 36, but Boswell missed a 54-yard field goal, keeping the Patriots ahead 27-16. Later in the fourth quarter, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 45, but turned the ball over on downs after Jones threw an incomplete pass on 4th-and-11.

"wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_1129": {"passage": "Coming off their bye week, the Patriots traveled to Candlestick Park to face the 49ers in the first of two straight West Coast games for the Patriots. After a 49ers punt on their first series started the game, Cassel's second pass of the game was intercepted by linebacker Takeo Spikes to give the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 45-yard line. On the next play, 49ers quarterback J. T. O'Sullivan threw an interception of his own, this one to Meriweather at the Patriots' 4-yard line. A three-and-out for the Patriots on their ensuing drive ended in a 35-yard Chris Hanson punt that gave the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 30-yard line to begin their next drive. A defensive holding penalty on Patriots cornerback Deltha O'Neal on third down extended the drive, leading to a 16-yard touchdown catch by running back Frank Gore that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead. On the Patriots' next drive, a fumbled snap by Cassel set up 3rd and 8 from the Patriots' own 34-yard line; Cassel then threw a deep pass to Moss, which was caught at the 49ers' 21-yard line and run in for a 66-yard touchdown that tied the game at 7-7. A 38-yard Isaac Bruce reception from O'Sullivan on the 49ers' ensuing possession backed the Patriots' defense up to their own 22-yard line, and two plays later, O'Sullivan and Bruce again connected on a pass, this one a touchdown from 6 yards out to give the 49ers a 14-7 lead. An exchange of punts brought the teams into the second quarter, where on the third play of a Patriots drive Cassel threw his second interception of the day, this one to Nate Clements on the 49ers' 6-yard line on a deep pass intended to Moss. The 49ers went three-and-out, leading to a 13-play, 40-yard Patriots drive where a third down sack of Cassel in the red zone set up a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal that trimmed the 49ers' lead to 14-10. The 49ers punted again on their next possession, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 20-yard line with just over three minutes remaining in the first half. 11 plays later, the Patriots faced a 2nd and goal from the 49ers' 2-yard line, where a Faulk touchdown run gave the Patriots a 17-14 lead at halftime. On the Patriots' opening possession of the second half, Cassel was sacked to begin the drive, and then again was sacked nine plays later on third down to force the Patriots to punt. Two plays later, O'Sullivan was intercepted by safety Rodney Harrison to give the Patriots the ball at the 49ers' 24-yard line. The Patriots reached the 49ers' 1-yard line, but were denied the end zone twice by the 49ers, setting up fourth down from the 2-yard line. Faulk took the direct snap on the play and ran in for his second touchdown of the game, giving the Patriots a 24-14 lead. Following a 49ers punt, an 8-play Patriots drive resulted in a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 27-14 early in the fourth quarter. Starting from their own 20-yard line, the 49ers began an 11-play drive that ended on a 5-yard touchdown catch by Bruce from O'Sullivan that cut the Patriots' lead to 27-21. The Patriots responded with a 10-play series of their own; six plays into the drive, Faulk caught a second-down pass and was originally deemed to be down short of the first down, but the Patriots challenged the play and Faulk was found to have gained the necessary first down yardage. An offensive pass interference penalty on Moss set up a 3rd and 20 that the Patriots did not convert; Gostkowski then hit a 49-yard line field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 30-21. A third-down sack of O'Sullivan led to a fourth-down interception by O'Neal that gave the Patriots the ball with 2:45 remaining in the game. The 49ers used all of their timeouts during the Patriots' next possession, and after a Patriots punt, the 49ers failed to convert on fourth down to give the Patriots the ball to end the game.",

This game is well known by Packer fans for its ending. Towards the end, the Packers tried to lateral the ball to get down the field and score a game-winning touchdown. The play looked like a total bust, as Aaron Rodgers was wrapped up and brought down, seemingly ending the game. However, the Lions were called for a controversial facemask penalty that gave the Packers one more chance on an untimed down. On the next play, Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary pass to Richard Rodgers to end the game. The ball traveled 68 yards through the air, making it the longest touchdown pass in NFL history by air.

The remainder of the Packers' drives in the first half were largely unsuccessful. On the first play of the second quarter, Aaron Rodgers pass was tipped and then intercepted by Derrick Brooks. The turnover set the Buccaneers up on the Packers 32-yard line. Shortly thereafter, Brian Griese connected to Alex Smith to tie the score at 7. Later in the second quarter, Green Bay faced 4th & 15 at their own 5-yard line. Derrick Frost punted from the back of the endzone, but the punt took a \"Buccaneer bounce\" and was downed at the Green Bay 41-yard line. The resulting good field position led to a Matt Bryant field goal, and a 10-7 lead. Earlier in the week, Bryant suffered tragedy off the field, with the death of his 3-month old son Tryson. Four plays later, Rodgers was intercepted again, this time by Barrett Ruud. Before the end of the second quarter, Bryant kicked another field goal, and the Buccaneers led 13-7 at halftime. Tampa Bay took the second half kickoff, and drove to the Packers 17-yard line. A play later, however, Griese's pass was bobbled by Michael Clayton at the 5, and intercepted by Tramon Williams. After trading possessions, midway through the third quarter, Green Bay was at their own 40-yard line. Ryan Grant fumbled, and Jermaine Phillips recovered for a 38-yard Buccaneer touchdown. On the second play of Tampa Bay's next drive, Griese threw his second interception, which was returned to the 42-yard line. Aaron Rodgers threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings to trim the score to 20-14. Rodgers, however, appeared to injure his throwing arm on the play. Early in the fourth quarter, Griese threw his second straight interception (and third overall), which was returned 62 yards by Charles Woodson for a touchdown.

After a 38-yard field goal by Broncos' placekicker Brandon McManus gave the Broncos the lead late in the first quarter, the Bills grabbed the lead, with a 2-yard touchdown from quarterback Tyrod Taylor to wide receiver Andre Holmes on a deflected pass. The Broncos responded, when running back Jamaal Charles eluded Bills' defenders for a 12-yard touchdown &#8212; Charles' first touchdown as a Bronco. The Broncos were attempting to add to their lead on their next possession, however, a 44-yard pass completion from quarterback Trevor Siemian to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders was overturned by a Bills' challenge, as replay indicated that Sanders did not maintain full control of the football at the Bills' 44-yard line as cornerback Tre'Davious White knocked the ball out. McManus and Bills' placekicker Steven Hauschka proceeded to alternate field goals, with a 28-yarder by McManus giving the Broncos a 16-13 lead midway through the third quarter. However, the Broncos were held scoreless for the remainder of the game, and the Bills took the lead for good, with Taylor connecting with tight end Charles Clay on a 6-yard touchdown pass. A 53-yard field goal by Hauschka extended the Bills' lead to 23-16 early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos drove to as far as the Bills' 24-yard line on their first possession of the fourth quarter, however, Siemian was intercepted by White. Five plays later, the Broncos' defense forced an incomplete pass off Taylor at the Broncos' 46-yard line, hoping to receive the football back after a punt. However, linebacker Von Miller was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in which he offered to help Taylor off the turf, then pulled his hand back. After the Bills earned three first downs and forced the Broncos to use all of their team timeouts, Hauschka added a 27-yard field goal with 3:18 remaining in the game.

against the owners and managers of the island's plantations. Lasting several months into August 1734, the slave rebellion was one of the earliest and longest slave revolts in the Americas. The Akwamu slaves captured the fort in Coral Bay and took control of most of the island. They intended to resume crop production under their own control and use Africans of other tribes as slave labor. Planters regained control by the end of May 1734, after the Akwamu were defeated by several hundred better-armed French and Swiss troops sent in April from Martinique, a French colony.

Three years later, the Holy Roman Empire found itself on the brink of war when Wolfgang Wilhelm claimed that the normative year imposed by the treaty took precedence over the Treaty of Xanten in regard to church properties. Since more parishes were in Catholic hands in 1624 than a decade before, Wolfgang Wilhelm hoped to stabilize his control over J\u00fclich and Berg. The Aulic Council was still reviewing the evidence when Frederick William declared himself a protector of the Protestant population living in the two duchies. In June 1651, 3,800 Brandenburg troops invaded Berg, killing two civilians, bombarding Wolfgang Wilhelm's palace and seizing a herd of cows belonging to his wife. After rallying at Ka\u00dflerfeld, the Brandenburgers created an encampment at Angermund and unsuccessfully beleaguered D\u00fcsseldorf. The Neuburg envoy in Vienna described the incident as a \"Cow War\", comparing Brandenburg's ruler to a cattle rustler. By July, Brandenburg had reinforced its expedition by 2,700 troops, mobilizing 16,000 more across its various territories. Wolfgang Wilhelm employed the help of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who launched a counter invasion of Mark with the intention of obtaining provisions for his army. The estates of all five duchies refused to provide money to either side, while Duisburg's city council requested Dutch protection. The Dutch condemned the actions of their former ally, while Sweden persuaded both sides to disengage through their envoy Melchior von Hatzfeldt. By the end of the year, Neuburg and Brandenburg had disbanded their troops. The Aulic Council distributed the church property on the basis of the current year, ending the conflict.

Despite marrying, following the resignation of Ferdinando and the expulsion of Vincenzo from the Sacred College of Cardinals, neither produced any legitimate children.

In addition, the Dolphins were ranked second in the league in sacks on third and fourth downs with 10. However, the Bears' receivers posed a size threat to the Miami secondary, though Miami was ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed with 6.09, one of only eight teams allowing less than seven yards in 2014. The Dolphins also allowed only 3.8 yards per carry and yards allowed per play with 4.7 yards. On defense, the Bears would have to prepare for a Ryan Tannehill-led zone-read option offense, which has an average drive length of 3:08, third-fastest in the league. However, Tannehill could make mistakes, as he had thrown 35 interceptions in 37 career starts. The Dolphins also had the second-fewest completions of at least 20 yards with 11. The Bears would also have to watch the run game, which ranked third in the NFL with 4.97 yards per carry. Entering the game, the Bears' defense was tied for the fourth-most sacks (15), third-most interceptions (eight), and third in points recorded off turnovers (49). The Bears were the favorite by -3. Terrance Mitchell, Ahmad Dixon, Chris Conte, Lance Briggs, Jon Bostic, Charles Leno, Jr., and Trevor Scott were scratches for the game, while Jermon Bushrod, Brandon Marshall, Robbie Gould, Ryan Mundy and Jeremiah Ratliff were team captains. The Dolphins won the toss, and elected to receive. On the first play from scrimmage, Tannehill was sacked by Ratliff for a loss of five yards; Ratliff would finish the game with a career-high 3.5 sacks. After both teams punted on their first drives, the Dolphins scored first on Tannehill's 13-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay. On the Bears' next drive, Cutler fumbled on his own 38-yard line, but Ka'Deem Carey recovered the ball; the Bears would punt three plays later. Miami's eventual drive lasted into the second quarter, but ended with Caleb Sturgis missing a 50-yard field goal wide right. The Bears would reach the Dolphins' 37-yard line, but Cutler's pass for Martellus Bennett was intercepted by Reshad Jones, who returned the pick to the Bears' 29-yard line, and was stripped by Brandon Marshall, Koa Misi recovering at the 23-yard line. The fumble was subsequently challenged, but was upheld. Miami would drive to the Bears' eight-yard line, and two plays later, Tannehill threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace. Both teams would exchange punts at the end of the half, Miami leading 14-0. On their first drive of the second half, the Bears scored their first points of the game with Cutler's ten-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, though the Dolphins retaliated on their next possession with Lamar Miller's two-yard touchdown run. The Bears' drive lasted into the fourth quarter, but ended at their own 24-yard line when Wake strip-sacked Cutler, recovering it at Chicago's 16. The Dolphins would go three-and-out on the drive, resorting to Sturgis' 33-yard field goal. On the Bears' next drive, Cutler threw a pass to Dante Rosario, who fumbled after being stripped by Cortland Finnegan, Randy Starks recovering at the Bears' 35-yard line. However, the Dolphins failed to take advantage of the takeaway, Sturgis' 37-yard field goal being blocked by Lamarr Houston. Starting from their own 27, the Bears reached the Dolphins' 44, and a defensive pass interference penalty on Jason Taylor brought the Bears to the five-yard line. Three plays later, Forte scored on a one-yard run. The Dolphins would score on their next drive via Miller's four-yard run, but was nullified by holding penalty on Clay; Sturgis would kick a 19-yard field goal to make the score 27-14. Chicago's final drive reached Miami's 15-yard line, but the offense failed to gain ground, Cutler first throwing an incomplete pass, then fumbling but recovering, and finally throwing two more incomplete passes. Tannehill would kneel twice to end the game. The Bears fell to 0-4 in games where Cutler throws an interception. After the game, in the Bears' locker room, there were reports of shouting and players being pulled out of the room, with Marshall calling out Cutler, and Kyle Long criticizing the fans. Former Bears linebacker Blake Costanzo was also critical, stating Marc Trestman had \"made the Bears soft\". In an interview, Gould stated, \"Everyone's trying to make this a story out of something that really wasn't that big of a deal. Obviously everyone's frustrated. Everyone wants to win. Our fans want to win. Coaches want to win. The players want to win. And everyone's obviously frustrated.\"", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many wins did the Bears have through Week 3?", "answer": {"number": "0", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b9c09bbf-e9e1-402f-b444-18fdd58cd614"}, {"question": "How many times did Ryan Tannehill kneel in this game?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "232e45dd-2c58-437b-9df7-eb2eb5b1fc18"}, {"question": "What happened on the first play of the game?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Tannehill was sacked by Ratliff", "for a loss of five", "yards"]}, "query_id": "7c3f9cb5-58a8-410f-ab84-ad0a0b45ca36"}, {"question": "How many challenges were there in this game?", "answer": {"number": "1", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "6a4210ab-b465-4949-a32b-960d88007e53"}, {"question": "How many points were the Bears favored by in this game?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b30776c2-816a-4089-89c0-e8423ce96c68"}, {"question": "Which team attempted the first field goal?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Dolphins"]}, "query_id": "18a375c0-4e05-49c2-b113-9a9e13089732", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many points were the Bears trailing by at halftime?", "answer": {"number": "14", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b2d767e4-eef9-49a1-b156-b1ca945aeac4", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the longest touchdown pass of the first half?", "answer": {"number": "13", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "9af65911-fb6d-4be4-bf37-f4737713da94", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many field goals did Sturgis miss?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "8d632cd0-d81c-402b-9cbd-238699fb5427", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many total points were scored by halftime?", "answer": {"number": "14", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "8cba9cf8-a155-4ca4-a038-0cf174dd82b4", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many total points were scored?", "answer": {"number": "41", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "c5843e84-5733-41f9-a332-06cb37f91012", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "history_1830": {"passage": "During the civil war, and the ensuing Soviet\u2013Afghan War, most of the countrys infrastructure was destroyed, and normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted.

They also occupied Vinegar Hill, where the United Irishmen had made a last stand in the 1798 rebellion. The public largely supported the rebels and many local men offered to join them. By Saturday, up to 1,000 rebels had been mobilised, and a detachment was sent to occupy the nearby village of Ferns. In Wexford, the British assembled a column of 1,000 soldiers , two field guns and a 4.7 inch naval gun on a makeshift armoured train.

The Giants started off well, stopping the Eagles quickly. Chad Morton then returned a punt to the Eagle 21 and Tiki Barber scored from 11 yards out giving New York an early lead.  After Philadelphia converted a third and 11, quarterback Jeff Garcia drove his team the length of field and Correll Buckhalter tied the game.  The Giants offense, although moving well, was hurt by several penalties and fumbles by Visanthe Shiancoe and Brandon Jacobs. The Eagles went ahead 14-7 with a one-yard run by Brian Westbrook on fourth down, and the Giants added a Jay Feely field goal to make it 14-10 at the recess. The Giants had several opportunities to take command in the second half, but red zone difficulties, similar to those experienced against the Cowboys in week 13, hurt their chances.  Eli Manning hit Plaxico Burress in stride for a big gain to get inside the 10, but were forced to settle for a field goal. After forcing a fumble on the ensuing Eagles possession, the Giants had the ball first and goal from the seven-yard line, but two runs and a pass yielded zero yards and Feely kicked another short field goal, putting the Giants ahead 16-14. The Eagles came right back as Reno Mahe returned the ensuing kick 64 yards for Philadelphia. Westbrook then ran through a gaping hole 28 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles' next drive ended with an interception by Giants cornerback Will Demps. The Giants took advantage on a drive culminating with a Jacobs score from one yard out.  After the score, the Giants went for the two-point conversion, but were denied on a draw play, leaving the score 22-21 with seven minutes remaining. Garcia responded swiftly by driving his squad 80 yards in eight plays; an 18-yard strike to Reggie Brown and a conversion put the Eagles up seven.  Manning was then intercepted on the following drive for an insurance touchdown by Trent Cole, ostensibly putting the game away for Philadelphia. For the game, the Eagles 31st-ranked rush defense held the Giants to 88 net running yards, Manning threw for 282 yards on 28 of 40 passing, Burress recorded 120 receiving yards and Jeremy Shockey had eight receptions for 70 yards. Carlos Emmons and Will Demps recorded the only sacks for the Giants.  For Philadelphia, Jeff Garcia continued his surprising rebirth, completing 19 of 28 passes for 237 yards and one touchdown (along with one interception), and Brian Westbrook gained over 140 total yards while scoring a touchdown.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "How many completions did Garcia have?", "answer": {"number": "19", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "730e1e74-7d30-498a-ad3e-340b1e1a7de1"}, {"question": "How many touchdowns were scored in the first two quarters?", "answer": {"number": "3", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "d4eb70d3-9382-499f-91b1-64379be61ae4", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "Which quarterback had more incomplete passes?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Manning"]}, "query_id": "6358c449-4fd6-4560-b1ac-cee17b57f8d7", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many interceptions came in the last two quarters?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "dfccea85-d541-46bd-904a-e5c98ddaca83", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many passes did Jeff Garcia throw?", "answer": {"number": "28", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "7a15d9ca-fa15-4c51-ac07-6be5522fabf3", "highlights": [], "question_type": []}, {"question": "How many passes did Manning throw that were not complete?", "answer": {"number": "12", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "a1b12636-3f17-413d-8485-d07ab86b0289", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many of Manning's passing yards were to players other than Burress?", "answer": {"number": "162", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "f9d906fb-6a79-4a9a-a142-ca497b48ba1d", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many receiving yards did Shockey and Burress have combined?", "answer": {"number": "190", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "869c1c5d-b9fb-4199-bbb9-2cd2f81c69b3", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many more passing yards did Manning have than Garcia?", "answer": {"number": "45", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "66961636-7e37-440a-a0e1-6621fc8152a0", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many yards was the difference between the first and last touchdowns?", "answer": {"number": "7", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "614142b9-329b-4ece-ab20-3431d818d1c0", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "How many touchdowns between 10 and 20 yards were there?", "answer": {"number": "2", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "b872f763-777c-4f1d-810a-e6d0de43829e", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_3047": {"passage": "After a tough opening loss to the St. Louis Rams, the Seahawks traveled to Green Bay to take on the Packers.

In doing so, Romania's goal was to unite all the territories with a Romanian national majority into one state. In the Treaty of Bucharest , terms for Romania's acquisition of territories within Austria-Hungary were stipulated. In 1918, after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks signed a separate peace with the Central Powers in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Romania was alone on the Eastern Front, a situation that far surpassed its military capabilities. Therefore, on 7 May 1918, Romania sued for peace. The prime minister of Romania, Alexandru Marghiloman, signed the Treaty of Bucharest  with the Central Powers. However, this treaty was never signed by King Ferdinand of Romania. At the end of 1918 Romania's situation was dire. She was suffering from the consequences of punitive war reparations. Dobruja was under Bulgarian occupation. The German army under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen was retreating through Romania. The bulk of the Romanian army was demobilized, leaving only four full-strength divisions. A further eight divisions were left in a reserve status. The four battle-ready divisions were used to keep order and protect Basarabia from possible hostile actions of the Soviet Union. On 10 November 1918, taking advantage of the Central Powers' precarious situation, Romania re-entered the war on the side of the Allied forces, with similar objectives to those of 1916. King Ferdinand called for the mobilization of the Romanian army and ordered it to attack by crossing the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania. The end of World War I that soon followed did not bring an end to  fighting for the Romanian army.

Four plays after the Patriots punted again, Ninkovich intercepted Henne at the Patriots 40. The Patriots drove all the way to the Dolphins 5, but settled for a 23-yard field goal by Gostkowski.

The Sarmatians differed from the Scythians in their veneration of the god of fire rather than god of nature, and their women's prominent role in warfare, which possibly served as the inspiration for the Amazons. At their greatest reported extent, around 1st century AD, these tribes ranged from the Vistula River to the mouth of the Danube and eastward to the Volga, bordering the shores of the Black and Caspian seas as well as the Caucasus to the south. Their territory, which was known as Sarmatia to Greco-Roman ethnographers, corresponded to the western part of greater Scythia .

Oakland started well, recovering a muffed fumble by Tyreek Hill on a punt following their first drive and setting them up at the Kansas City 38-yard line. However, the Raiders had to settle for a field goal by Sebastian Janikowsi to take the early 3-0 lead. It would be the last lead the Raiders enjoyed on the night. Oakland's offense could muster little for most of the first half including after the Raider defense stopped KC on a fourth and one at the Oakland 27. The Chiefs took the lead early in the second quarter on a 36-yard pass from Alex Smith to Hill to make the score 7-3. After a four-and-out possession for the Raiders, the Chiefs again went down the field scoring on a Charcandrick West three-yard touchdown run. Following another Raiders short offensive possession, Hill returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown to extend the Chief lead to 21-3. With six minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders went up-tempo and moved the ball down the field capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray with 14 seconds remaining. At the half, the Raiders trailed 21-10. To begin the second half, the Raider defense stepped up intercepting Smith on the second play of the half and giving the offense the ball at the KC 23. However, the offense was shut down by the KC defense and settled for another Janikowski field goal, bringing them within a touchdown of the Chiefs at 21-13. On the next offensive play for the Chiefs, Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Smith of the ball and the Raiders recovered at the KC 18-yard line. The offense again managed little and was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. However, a bad snap resulted in Marquette King being tackled for three-yard loss. Both offenses mustered very little for the remainder of the game. With seven minutes left in the game, the Raiders needed a touchdown to tie and moved down to the KC 19-yard line, but were stopped on fourth down and the Chiefs ran the clock out.

Carr admitted he had a bad night saying, \"Obviously, we didn't do enough.\" The loss ended the Raiders six-game win streak and gave the Chiefs the lead in the division with a 2-0 record over the Raiders.

The Chiefs ran 70 plays to the Chargers' 49, and controlled the ball for 39 minutes during the game to San Diego's 21. San Diego was just 3-for-10 on third down conversions after entering the game with a 53.8% success rate, the highest in the league. The loss ended the team's six-game home winning streak over the Chiefs. The Chargers got out to a 7-0 lead after tight end John Phillips' first catch of the season, a 1-yard TD from Rivers. They regained the lead, 14-10, after Gates' 27-yard TD off a tipped pass 14 seconds before halftime. San Diego was limited to just one offensive drive in the third quarter, a three-and-out series that lasted just 1:02, and Kansas City led 20-14 after an Alex Smith 11-yard TD pass to Anthony Sherman with 14:50 left in the fourth. The Chargers responded with a 12-play drive, driving all the way to the Chiefs 6, but settled for a Novak 24-yard field goal. After a defensive stop, Novak kicked a 48-yarder to tied the game at 20 with 1:57 remaining. It was his 31st straight field goal, breaking Carney's team record of 29 set from 1992 to 1993. However, the Chiefs drove 62 yards on nine plays on their game-winning drive. Rivers was 17 of 31 for 205 yards and two touchdowns with a 83.4 rating, breaking his streak of games with 120 or higher.

Chiefs coach Andy Reid, in his second year with the team, improved his career record to 14-2 coming off a bye week.

split in their season series with the Patriots and a lead in the AFC East, the Jets traveled to Foxboro to face the Patriots on a Thursday night. The Jets' Leon Washington returned the opening kickoff 30 yards to start the Jets' first drive from their own 38-yard line. Four plays in, an incompletion from Jets quarterback Brett Favre to Coles appeared to set up a fourth down, but the Jets challenged the play and won; the catch gave the Jets a first down from the Patriots' 37-yard line. Shortly after a 20-yard Dustin Keller catch extended the Jets' drive on third down again, a 7-yard Washington touchdown run gave the Jets a 7-0 lead. The Patriots responded by moving into Jets' territory on their first drive, but were later forced to settle for a 42-yard Gostkowski field goal that cut the Jets' lead to 7-3. Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 37 yards to give the Jets the ball at their own 36-yard line for the beginning of their next possession. Another Keller catch on third down put the Jets into Patriots territory; a Pierre Woods unnecessary roughness penalty moved the Patriots defense back further, eventually to their own 5-yard line on a Jets first down. However, the Jets managed to move the ball only one more yard, leading to a 22-yard Feely field goal that extended the Jets' lead to 10-3 at the end of the first quarter. The Patriots' second drive of the game went for 59 yards on 12 plays, but a Morris run for no gain and two incompletions from the Jets' 13-yard line set up a 31-yard Gostkowski field to trim the Jets' lead to 10-6. Taking the ensuing kickoff from the Jets' 8-yard line, Washington went 92 yards for the touchdown, opening the Jets' lead to 17-6. The Patriots punted on their next possession, giving the Jets the ball at their own 13-yard line. Favre began the drive with an 18-yard pass to wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery, and then two plays later, a 46-yard Cotchery catch put the Jets on the Patriots' 16-yard line; Favre hit Cotchery yet again two plays later, this time for a 15-yard touchdown reception that gave the Jets a 24-6 lead. On the Patriots' next possession, a 43-yard Sam Aiken catch on a screen pass put the Patriots in Jets territory; a 9-yard Cassel scramble set up 3rd-and-1. A Heath Evans run was stopped for a loss of two yards, and Cassel was sacked by C. J. Mosley on fourth down to turn the ball over on downs for the Patriots at the Jets' 30-yard line. The Jets then went three-and-out for the first time in the game, giving the Patriots, with one timeout remaining, the ball at their own 32-yard line with 1:44 remaining in the first half. The Patriots did not call their final timeout until multiple completed Cassel passes, a 19-yard scramble, and a successful quarterback sneak to convert on fourth down gave the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 19-yard line with 31 seconds left in the first half. After two incomplete passes, Cassel threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Gaffney to cut the Jets' lead to 24-13 heading into halftime. Having the ball to start the second half, the Patriots moved to the Jets' 34-yard line on four plays, but on a subsequent 12-yard Watson reception, the tight end fumbled as he was being tackled by linebacker Eric Barton; the loose ball was recovered by safety Kerry Rhodes and returned 11 yards to the Jets' 33-yard line. However, two sacks of Favre by Wilfork and Seymour, both for losses of nine yards, forced the Jets into their second three-and-out series of the night. Cassel was sacked on the next play, but four plays later, the Patriots had a first down from the Jets' 38-yard line. Patriots center Dan Koppen, who had left the game with an injury in the second quarter but later returned, snapped the ball while Cassel was making adjustments at the line and was not ready to receive the snap. Cassel chased the Koppen fumble and recovered it at the Patriots' 38-yard line for a loss of 24 yards. The Patriots, later facing 4th-and-21, punted to give the Jets the ball at their own 16-yard line. A Jets punt was followed by an exchange of three-and-outs, eventually setting up a Patriots drive to begin from their own 22-yard line. A 29-yard Welker reception put the Patriots in Jets territory; five plays later, Watson caught a 10-yard touchdown pass, his first of the year, cutting the Jets' lead to 24-19. On the final snap of the third quarter, the Patriots attempted a two-point conversion and succeeded; the Gaffney catch put the Patriots to within a field goal, trailing 24-21. Five plays into the Jets' next drive, Patriots cornerback Jason Webster forced Cotchery to fumble a 9-yard reception; Guyton recovered the fumble at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The Patriots next possession featured an entirely shotgun, no-huddle offense, with a 17-yard Cassel scramble moving the Patriots back into Jets territory. Four plays later, a 47-yard Gostkowski field goal tied the game. Starting from their own 33-yard line after the Patriots directed the kickoff to linebacker David Bowens instead of to Washington, the Jets began what would be a 14-play drive with just over 10 minutes left in the game. The Jets then moved the ball to the Patriots' 7-yard line to set up a 3rd-and-7 with 3:38 left in the game. Favre's pass intended to Cotchery fell incomplete, but Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel was called for a defensive holding penalty, giving the Jets an automatic first down from the Patriots' 3-yard line. The Jets failed to score on two straight runs, while the Patriots used two timeouts to stop the clock after each play. On the third rushing attempt, Thomas Jones scored from a yard out to give the Jets a 31-24 lead with 3:10 left in the game. Cassel was sacked on second down of the Patriots' next drive, forcing them to punt on three-and-out but not having to use their timeout until the Jets' next possession, when they used it in conjunction with the two-minute warning to get the ball back with 1:04 left in the game after a Jets punt. Starting from their own 38-yard line, the Patriots moved to the Jets' 42-yard line on two Cassel completions; a spike stopped the clock at&#160;:36. A 17-yard Welker catch and another spike then put the Patriots at the Jets' 25-yard line with&#160;:23 left. A Koppen false start moved the Patriots back 5 yards, but a 14-yard Welker catch and another spike put the Patriots on the Jets' 16-yard line with 8 seconds to go. On the ensuing play, Moss was covered by former Patriots cornerback Ty Law, who returned to the Jets for a second stint with the team just days earlier after sitting out the first 10 weeks of the season. As Cassel eluded a pass rusher and moved into the flat, Moss looked for the pass from the near corner of the end zone. Cassel threw to Moss, who caught the pass just beyond the near pylon and fell out of bounds, giving the Patriots a 16-yard touchdown with 1 second remaining in the game. A booth review was called but determined Moss did indeed have possession and the necessary footing before he fell out of bounds, upholding the touchdown call and sending the game into overtime after the extra point. Even though the Patriots had won their last eight overtime games, they began the sudden death period on defense as the Jets won the overtime coin toss. On the first play of the Jets' possession, Favre was sacked for a loss of five yards; an incomplete pass set up a 3rd-and-15 from the Jets' 15-yard line. However, Favre found Keller for a 16-yard catch and the first down; and then did so again two plays later, this one for 12 yards to move the Jets to their own 47-yard line. Three plays later, on a 3rd-and-1 from the Patriots' 44-yard line, Keller caught his third first down catch of the drive. This was followed by a 16-yard Coles catch two plays later, giving the Jets a first down from the Patriots' 24-yard line. On 4th-and-2 from the Patriots' 16-yard line, Feely hit a 34-yard field goal to give the Jets a 34-31 overtime win, dropping the Patriots to second in the division with a 6-4 record. The Patriots' total of 511 net yards in the game was the fourth-best in franchise history, and the highest since 1979. Cassel's 62 rushing yards were the most by a Patriots quarterback since Steve Grogan had 68 yards in 1978. Moreover, Cassel's 400 passing yards and 62 rushing yards made him the first player since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to have at least 400 passing and 60 rushing yards in a single game, and the first Patriots quarterback to throw for 300 yards and rush for 50 in the same game.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "how many yards did washington kickoff with?", "answer": {"number": "30", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "298673af-6bfc-42f6-8d83-8485694aa7d5"}, {"question": "how many yards did gostkowski get?", "answer": {"number": "42", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": []}, "query_id": "7f402d2c-12c3-47f9-9596-946ac1ae269e"}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "history_680": {"passage": "In 1895, members of the Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers reenacted their famous stand at Rorke's Drift, 18 years earlier. 25 British soldiers beat back the attack of 75 Zulus at the Grand Military Fete at the Cheltenham Winter Gardens. Veterans of the American Civil War recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. The Great Reunion of 1913, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, was attended by more than 50,000 Union and Confederate veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including Pickett's Charge. During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in Russia with reenactments of the Siege of Sevastopol  , the Battle of Borodino  in St Petersburg and the Taking of Azov  in Voronezh in 1918. In 1920, there was a reenactment of the 1917 Storming of the Winter Palace on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in Sergei Eisenstein's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World. Large scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the Siege of Namur, an important military engagement of the Nine Years' War, was staged in 1934 as part of 6-day long show. In America, modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961-1965 Civil War Centennial commemorations. After more than 6,000 reenactors participated in a 125th anniversary event near the original Manassas battlefield, reenacting grew in popularity during the late 1980s and 1990s, and there are today

The odds had been influenced by Aaron Rodgers' season-ending collarbone injury in October along with backup quarterback Brett Hundley's struggles in the previous week's 30-17 loss to the Lions. Although the Bears had not defeated the Packers at home since 2010, the Packers were 2-3 since the two teams' last meeting in week four, while Green Bay head coach Mike McCarthy was 1-3 against the Bears without Rodgers. Jeff Joniak described his ideal Bears offensive gameplan as \"laying a clean game\" to avoid swinging the \"tempo or momentum in favor of a team that's on a three-game losing streak.\" To do this, Mitchell Trubisky would have to avoid getting sacked, while the running game would have to reduce its runs resulting in negative yardage. Through the air, the Bears remained an unknown entity due to a lack of available film on Trubisky and receivers Markus Wheaton and Dontrelle Inman, the latter making his Bears debut in week ten after being traded to the team in late October. On defense, Joniak wrote the unit needed to prevent Hundley from developing his accuracy, especially as the Chicago defense was excelling in preventing touchdowns, along with containing running back Ty Montgomery, who recorded 162 rushing yards on 16 carries against the Bears in week sixteen last year. In a game that ChicagoBears.com writer Larry Mayer described as having \" to an early-season trend, the Bears shot themselves in the foot repeatedly,\" Chicago struggled with penalties during the game as the team committed seven in the first half. The Bears punted on the first drive, which led to an exchanging of field goals on Mason Crosby's 40- and Connor Barth's 45-yard kicks. Three drives later, in the second quarter, Montgomery scored on a 37-yard touchdown run to give the Packers the lead. On the next drive, Trubisky threw a screen pass to Benny Cunningham, who ran to the Packers' goal line and dived for the pylon. His knee landed out of bounds and the play was ruled as such at the two-yard line, which the Bears challenged with the belief that the ball had reached the pylon before he went out; instead, the challenge went against the Bears when it was determined he had lost the ball before it had touched the pylon, resulting in a touchback and possession being granted to the Packers. Chicago eventually added three more points on Barth's 44-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. Crosby kicked a 24-yard field goal on the first drive of the second half, which was followed by one from 50 yards in the fourth quarter. The Bears ended their touchdown-scoring troubles (scoring just one touchdown in 35 drives across the previous four games) when Trubisky threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to Josh Bellamy, who escaped Davon House for the score. However, the Packers responded with a 75-yard drive that ended with Hundley's 19-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams. Barth added a 49-yard field goal to draw the Bears within a touchdown, and remained in contention when Crosby missed a 35-yarder wide right with 1:02 left in the game. After completing an 11-yard pass to Kendall Wright, Trubisky's next three passes were incomplete. On fourth-and-ten, Trubisky passed to Cunningham for five yards, who lateraled to Hroniss Grasu and ran two yards before he was tackled for a turnover on downs.", "qa_pairs": [{"question": "What packers trailed?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["Although the Bears now trailed"]}, "query_id": "862efa4d-b02e-4bc2-b280-4b0cdf82d0dc"}, {"question": "green bay among?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["book"]}, "query_id": "17b52ba3-34a0-4082-a477-024b0686ae76"}, {"question": "How many yards was the longest touchdown run?", "answer": {"number": "37", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": [], "worker_id": "", "hit_id": ""}, "query_id": "54d9dc57-4683-4b18-8ef7-64165582210a", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "What are the top two longest field goals made?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["49-yard", "49-yard"]}, "query_id": "b78f0341-3841-4084-8c5c-ad27e333d61c", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}, {"question": "What are the top two longest field goals made?", "answer": {"number": "", "date": {"day": "", "month": "", "year": ""}, "spans": ["49-yard", "45-yard"]}, "query_id": "64a45edf-7037-4357-b09f-ef6448b35a64", "highlights": [], "question_type": [], "validated_answers": [], "expert_answers": []}], "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Cleveland_Browns"}, "nfl_57": {"passage": "In order to remain in contention for the playoffs, the Bills had to defeat&#8212;and sweep&#8212;the Dolphins, which they did in convincing and dominating fashion.

In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, fought near Sarmada on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of Ilghazi, the ruler of Mardin. Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened. Baldwin asked for help from Pope Callixtus II. The pope forwarded the request to Venice. The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. Once the Venetians decided to participate, Pope Callixtus II sent them his papal banner to signify his approval, At the First Council of the Lateran he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins. The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders. In 1122 the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, launched the seaborne crusade. The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the Venetian Lagoon on 8 August 1122. This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them. They invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of Aleppo, and imprisoned in Kharput. Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem.

Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare's play The Tempest.

Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber  and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \"Starving Time\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived , and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610 commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610 at age 56. Local legend says that he loved Bermuda so much that he requested that his heart be buried there. A marker in Somers' Gardens in St. George's marks the approximate location where his heart was supposed to have been buried.
